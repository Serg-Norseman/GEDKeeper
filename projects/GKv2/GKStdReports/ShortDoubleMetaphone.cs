/**
 * ShortDoubleMetaphone.cs
 * 
 * An implemenatation of Lawrence Phillips' Double Metaphone phonetic matching
 * algorithm, published in C/C++ Users Journal, June, 2000.  This implementation
 * implements Lawrence's proposed optimization, whereby four-character metaphone keys
 * are represented as four nibbles in an unsigned short.  This dramatically improves
 * storage and search efficiency.
 * 
 * This implementation was written by Adam J. Nelson (anelson@nullpointer.net).
 * It is based on the general C# implementation, also by Adam Nelson.
 * For the latest version of this implementation, implementations
 * in other languages, and links to articles I've written on the use of my various
 * Double Metaphone implementations, see:
 * http;//www.nullpointer.net/anelson/
 * 
 * Note that since this impl implements IComparable, it can be used to key associative containers,
 * thereby easily implementing phonetic matching within a simple container.  Examples of this
 * should have been included in the archive from which you obtained this file.
 * 
 * Current Version: 1.0.0
 * Revision History:
 * 	1.0.0 - ajn - First release

 * This implemenatation, and optimizations, Copyright (C) 2003, Adam J. Nelson
 * The Double Metaphone algorithm was written by Lawrence Phillips, and is
