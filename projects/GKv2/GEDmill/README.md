# GEDmill (Family History Website Generator)

GEDmill is an easy-to-use program that lets you create webpages from your family 
history data. It accepts output from most family history programs and uses it to 
build HTML webpages.

## Features

GEDmill's main features are:

* Creates a separate page for each individual, listing key events in their life, 
alongside a photograph (if available) and a family tree diagram.
* Provides references to all sources. Lets you see at a glance where a piece of 
information has come from, with images of certificates, official documents etc. where available.
* Option to hide certain individuals, for example to keep information about 
living relatives or others out of the website.
* Accepts family history data in GEDCOM format. Most family history applications 
have the option to export data in this format. GEDmill was designed with 
GEDCOM 5.5 in mind, but it can handle data in earlier formats.
* Creates standards compliant HTML web pages. All webpages are W3C XHTML 1.0 compliant.
* Generate files for a self-playing CD-ROM, to share your family history with 
others without the need for a website.
