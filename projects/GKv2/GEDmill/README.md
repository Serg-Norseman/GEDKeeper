# GEDmill (Family History Website Generator)

GEDmill is an easy-to-use program that lets you create webpages from your family 
history data. It accepts output from most family history programs and uses it to 
build HTML webpages.

## Features

GEDmill's main features are:

* Creates a separate page for each individual, listing key events in their life, 
alongside a photograph (if available) and a family tree diagram.
* Provides references to all sources. Lets you see at a glance where a piece of 
information has come from, with images of certificates, official documents etc. where available.
* Option to hide certain individuals, for example to keep information about 
living relatives or others out of the website.
* Creates standards compliant HTML web pages. All webpages are W3C XHTML 1.0 compliant.
* Generate files for a self-playing CD-ROM, to share your family history with 
others without the need for a website.
