0 @N1@ NOTE This is an ridiculously long line that exceeds the GEDCOM maximum line length of 255 characters so that we can test whether the readers can properly introduce CONC tags on the fly and keep going as if everything was ok when the file has lines that are way too long like this one is, even though there are lots of programs that write non-standard GEDCOM files.
