<h1>Relation Terminology</h1>
<p>Understanding of relation terminology is an essential part of any
work related to genealogy. Some terms that define relation degree, for
example, widespread word &quot;ancestor&quot;, have a general meaning:
ancestor is any person from the family tree, starting from the
grandfather. But there are terms that define relation degree between
persons strictly. Such terms must be used in a context, where they
correspond to their meaning. The following picture can help you gain
an understanding of relation terms.</p>

<p>Relation terminology is very varied and complicated. Most of the
terms get vanished from modern language or used very rarely. Some terms
are used only within specific communities. But when you are talking
with your relatives or elderly persons you may hear an unfamiliar word
in conversation. Therefore, there is reason to become more familiar
with relation terminology.</p>
<p>There are three groups of terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>relation (blood ties),</li>
<li>quality (by marriages),</li>
<li>close (spiritual) unrelated relations.</li>
</ul>
