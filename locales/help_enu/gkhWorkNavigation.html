    <h1>Navigation</h1>
    <p>
        One of the major GEDKeeper targets is to provide the very efficient
        navigation.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main window of GEDKeeper allows quick access to six
        main categories of records with a summary area to the right of the
        lists. There you can easily view information about a record and use
        hypertext links to go to another, related record.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following <a href="gkhRecordTypes.html">record types</a> are
        self-contained:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Notes</b> -- any text added to a person, family or event. When a
            respective option is on, notes can be viewed on a pedigree image.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Multimedia content</b> -- any kind of photo, an audio record, or
            video record that you attached to person, family, or event. You can
            also add text or other types of documents.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Sources</b> -- a special object that stores information about
            an archive or other types of documents or articles.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Groups</b> -- an object that can unite different individuals
            using some common attribute or relation. For example, you can create
            &quot;The Great Patriotic War veterans&quot; group and use it to
            quickly find all persons who participated in WWII.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>To access a list of records of each type, you use tabs.</p>
    <p><img src="images/winMain_Tabs.gif" title="Record tabs"></p>
    <p>The column lists display the most important information.</p>
    <p>
        You can use any column to order a list by clicking a
        column header.
    </p>
    <p>
        The record summary area shows links to other related records as blue
        underlined text. Clicking such text jumps you to a respective record
        in this, or another, list.
