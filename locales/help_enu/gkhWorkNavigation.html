    <h1>Navigation</h1>
    <p>
        One of the major GEDKeeper features is to provide very efficient
        navigation.
    </p>
    <p>
        That is why the main window of GEDKeeper allows quick access to the six
        main categories of records with a summary area to the right of the
        lists&#151;where you can easily view information about a record and use
        hyperlinks to go to other, related records.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following <a href="gkhRecordTypes.html">record types</a> are
        self-contained:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Notes</b> &#151; any text added to a person, family, or event. When a
            respective option is on, notes can be viewed on a pedigree image.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Multimedia content</b> &#151; any kind of photo, audio record, or
            video record, that you attached to a person, family or event. You can
            add text and other types of documents as well.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Sources</b> &#151; a special object that stores information about
            an archive or other types of documents or articles.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Groups</b> &#151; an object that can unite different individuals
            using some common attribute or relation. For example, you can create
            &quot;The Great Patriotic War veterans&quot; group and use it afterward to
            quickly find all persons who participated in WWII.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>To access a list of records of each type, you use tabs.</p>
    <p><img src="images/winMain_Tabs.gif" title="Record tabs"></p>
    <p>The lists&#39; columns show you the most important information.</p>
    <p>
        You can use any column to order a list. To do that just click a
        column header.
    </p>
    <p>
        The record summary area shows links to other related records as blue
        underlined text (hyperlinks). If you click such text you jump to a respective record
        in this or another list.
