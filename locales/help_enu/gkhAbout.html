<p><img src="images/GEDKeeper2.png" align="top" style="float:left; margin: 20px 20px 20px 20px;">
GEDKeeper is free software that manages your personal genealogical database. The 'GED' prefix in the product title stands for GEDCOM&#151;the international
de facto standard describing how to store and exchange genealogical data which is used by many commercial genealogical software. The only specification
used by GEDKeeper to store its data is GEDCOM. This extremely advances the GEDKeeper compatibility level with other products.</p>

<p>GEDKeeper has a very simple and self-explanatory user interface. If you have some computer experience this application is straightforward.
The target audience of the product is mostly Russian users; because GEDKeeper manipulates patronymic names and automatically handles a woman's last name using
specific features of the Russian language, etc.</p>

<p>This is a brief list of GEDKeeper features:
<ul>
<li>Very easy installation process.</li>
<li>Full support of the GEDCOM standard.</li>
<li>No limits to the number of persons and generations created.</li>
<li>Generates pedigrees.</li>

<li>Quick navigation and management of multimedia content.</li>
<li>Puts georeferenced data over Google Maps (&copy; Google).</li>

<p>The author's aim was to create an easy-to-use product and not an overladen all-in-one product. The primary goal is to invent a fast and effective tool to
manage personal genealogical databases. A tool that will become an addition to the traditional card index.</p>
