    <h1>Filter Masks</h1>
    <p>
        You use masks in GEDKeeper to narrow down persons, events, or locations.
        The text of a mask consists of general printable
        characters allowed for object names, and two special symbols
        &#39;*&#39; and &#39;?&#39; for wildcard support.
    </p>
    <p>
        The term <em>mask</em> is used because the &#39;*&#39; and &#39;?&#39;
        symbols mask some arbitrary parts of a value.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>&#39;*&#39; inside a pattern matches any number of any characters.</li>
        <li>&#39;?&#39; matches one single character.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you want to specify several different masks, you can use the
        &quot;|&quot; symbol to delimit each mask. For example, to get all
        persons with names Mitch and John you can use the &quot;*Mitch*|*John*&quot;
        mask. The &quot;|&quot; symbol acts as an &quot;OR&quot; conjunction,
        therefore any person whose name matches one of the masks, matches the
        entire &quot;Mitch*|John*&quot; mask.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any person&#39;s name, event, or location will always match the &#39;*&#39;
        mask. When you use such a mask as a filter, it will show all objects.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you need to see all persons with &quot;Ivanov&quot; as beginning part of the last
        name, you would use a &quot;Ivanov*&quot; mask in the &quot;Name mask&quot; filter.
        The asterick symbol (&quot;*&quot;) matches any characters after the initial substring
        &quot;Ivanov&quot;. This way you get all persons with Ivanov,
        Ivanovskih, and so on as a last name. If you want to filter out all
        persons with &quot;Vasiliy&quot; as a first name, you should use a &quot;*Vasiliy *&quot;
        mask; thus you are masking any last name and
        surname. To get all women with Vasilevna surname you use &quot;*Vasilevna&quot;, masking any first name and last name.
    </p>
    <p>
        Examples:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>Names &quot;Litvin Ivan Andreevich&quot; and &quot;Semenov Ivan Andreevich&quot; can be filtered with a &quot;*Ivan Andreevich&quot; mask.</li>
            <li>Any person with first name, last name, or surname having &quot;Ivan&quot; inside, matches the &quot;*Ivan*&quot; mask.</li>
            <li>Any person with the name &quot;Natal<strong>i</strong>a&quot; or &quot;Natal<strong>y</strong>a&quot; is matched with the &quot;Natal?a*&quot; mask.</li>
        </ul>
