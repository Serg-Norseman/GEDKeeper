    <h1>Filter masks</h1>
    <p>
        You use masks in GEDKeeper to select persons, events, or locations
        having a specific name. Text of a mask consists of general printable
        characters, allowed for object names, and two special symbols:
        &quot;<samp>*</samp>&quot; and &quot;<samp>?</samp>&quot;.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <em>Mask</em> name is used because the &quot;<samp>*</samp>&quot; and &quot;<samp>?</samp>&quot;
        symbols mask some arbitrary parts of a value.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>&quot;<samp>*</samp>&quot; inside a mask matches any number of any characters.</li>
        <li>&quot;<samp>?</samp>&quot; matches any single character.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you want to specify several different masks, you use the
        &quot;<samp>|</samp>&quot; symbol to delimit each mask. For example, to get all
        persons with names Mitch and John you can use the &quot;<samp>*Mitch*|*John*</samp>&quot;
        mask. The &quot;<samp>|</samp>&quot; symbol acts as an &quot;OR&quot; conjunction,
        therefore any person whose name matches one of the masks, matches the
        entire &quot;<samp>Mitch*|John*</samp>&quot; mask.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any person's name, event, or location always matches the &quot;<samp>*</samp>&quot;
        mask. When you use such a mask in a filter, it will show all objects.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you need to get all persons with &quot;Johnson&quot; as a last
        name, you use the &quot;<samp>Johnson*</samp>&quot; mask in the &quot;Name mask&quot; filter.
        The &quot;<samp>*</samp>&quot; symbol matches any characters after the initial substring
        &quot;Johnson&quot;. This way you get all persons with Johnson,
        Johnsons, and so on as their last name. If you want to filter all
        persons with &quot;Joe&quot; as a first name, you would use the &quot;<samp>
            *
            Joe *
        </samp>&quot; mask; thus you are masking any last name and
        surname. To get all people with the &quot;Smith&quot; surname you use &quot;<samp>
            *
            Smith
        </samp>&quot;, masking any first name and last name.
    </p>

    <p>
        Examples:
        <ul>
            <li>
                The names &quot;Mary Anne Johnson&quot; and &quot;Elizabeth Anne
                Johnson&quot; can be filtered with the &quot;<samp>*Anne Johnson</samp>&quot;
                mask.
            </li>
            <li>
                Any person with a first name, last name, or surname having
                &quot;George&quot; inside, matches the &quot;<samp>*George*</samp>&quot; mask.
            </li>
            <li>
                Any person with the names &quot;Natal<strong>i</strong>a&quot; or
                &quot;Natal<strong>y</strong>a&quot; matches the &quot;<samp>Natal?a*</samp>&quot;
                mask.
            </li>
        </ul>
