    <h1>Tools: Merging Duplicates</h1>
    <p>
        This tool removes duplicates (repetitions) among persons in the
        database. The tool shows a prompting window where you must
        manually select a record to remain
        and which record to delete (or give this choice to GEDKeeper).
        When the removed person record has links, they may be
        moved into the remaining person.
    </p>
    <p>
        The merging duplicates tool also processes notes, families, and sources.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is recommended to search duplicates with the &quot;Check the year of
        birth&quot; option turned on (&quot;Options&quot; tab). This may reduce
        the number of false operations.
