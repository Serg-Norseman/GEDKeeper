    <h1>Tools: Merging records</h1>

    <p>
        This tool removes duplicates among persons in the
        database. The tool shows a prompting window where you must
        select a record to remain
        and a record to delete (or give this choice to GEDKeeper). When the removed person has links, they may be
        moved into the remaining person.
    </p>

    <p>
        This tool also processes notes, families, and sources.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is recommended to search for duplicates with &quot;Check the year of birth&quot; option turned on (from the &quot;Options&quot; tab). This reduces the
        number of false operations.
