    <h1>Portable Application</h1>

    <p>
        A portable application is a program designed to read and write its
        configuration settings into an accessible folder in the computer. This generally
        refers to the folder where the portable application can be found. This makes it easy
        to transfer the program, with user preferences and data, to a different computer.
        There are two options for making GEDKeeper portable:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Copy the file <kbd>GEDKeeper2.exe</kbd> to a directory (e.g., &#39;<kbd>c:\apps\GEDKeeper</kbd>&#39;). Then create a subdirectory
                for the application data where <kbd>GEDKeeper2.exe</kbd> is located (e.g., &#39;<kbd>c:\apps\GEDKeeper\appddata</kbd>&#39;).
            </li>
            <li>
                GEDKeeper supports the command line option &#39;<kbd>-homedir:<i>path</i></kbd>&#39; where <i><kbd>path</kbd></i>
                is the directory to store the configuration files (the settings). Both absolute and relative directories are supported.
                If this option is not used, the directory defaults to the system dependent path for a users&#39; data
                (i.e., in Windows this would be &#39;<kbd>%APPDATA%\GEDKeeper2</kbd>&#39;).
                <p>
                    If a subdirectory called &#39;<kbd>appdata</kbd>&#39; exists in the directory where
                    GEDKeeper is located then the &#39;<kbd>-homedir:<i>path</i></kbd>&#39; option is ignonred.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
