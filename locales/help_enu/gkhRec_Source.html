    <h1>Source record</h1>
    <p>
        A source is a reference to any private document, or a file from an archive
        site, where you found information about a person. Source records
        are used for the following purposes: they store specific information
        about the information&#39;s origin and unite and simplify research for a person,
        family and event, that was mentioned in a document.
    </p>
    <p>
        This can be a birth or death certificate, a census, a register of
        births, a confessional book, or other document types.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each <a href="gkhRec_SrcLink.html">source reference</a> has two
        additional properties: page or sheet number where the mentioning was
        made, and authenticity level for the information. Having a page or sheet
        number is helpful when you need to review the source again.
        An authenticity level quickly shows you how much you can trust a source of
        information. When a source document has blots or damage, and
        you could not have read text with assurance, you might assign
        &quot;Questionable reliability of evidence&quot; as the level to such a source.
        This can prevent you from false conclusions.
    </p>
    <p>
        An authenticity level also affects the <a href="gkhCAIndex.html">authenticity index</a>; which is
        calculated for a person in a <a href="gkhStats.html">statistics</a>
        module to analyze arithmetic mean values. <a href="gkhTreeChart.html">
            Tree
            diagrams
        </a> use an authenticity level to make displayed information more
        obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
        A source record also has an <a href="gkhRec_Repo.html">archive</a> (repository) property that
        defines where the source is stored. It is worth noting that the term &quot;archive&quot;
        here is not necessarily a state archive or private archive institution,
        but it is might also be a private document collection or other type of document
        storage.
    </p>
    <p align="center"><img src="images/dlgSourceEdit.gif"></p>

    <p>
        There is a uniting table on the &quot;Sources&quot; tab of the main
        working window, which includes all sources available in the database.
        A source summary to the right of the table shows all information about the
        selected source and links made from other records to the one selected.
