    <h1>Source Record</h1>
    <p>
        A source is referencing any document or file from the archive
        collection where information about a person is found.
        Source records are used for the following purposes: storing specific information
        about the origin of the information and to unite and simplify a search for person,
        family, and event that were mentioned in the document.
    </p>
    <p>
        This can be a birth or death certificate, audit tale, register of
        births, confessional book, census report, and other documents.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each <a href="gkhRec_SrcLink.html">source reference</a> has two
        additional properties: page or sheet number where the mentioning was
        made, and authenticity level for the information. Having a page or sheet
        number is helpful when you need to review the source once again.
        Authenticity level quickly shows you how much you can trust a source of
        information.
        When a source document cannot be viewed with assurance of its&#39;
        reliability due to blots or other damage, we recommend assigning the
        &quot;Questionable reliability of evidence&quot; level to the source.
        This can help prevent false conclusions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Authenticity level also affects the authenticity index; which is
        calculated for a person in the <a href="gkhStats.html">statistics</a>
        module to analyze <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean" target="_blank">mean values</a>.
        <a href="gkhTreeChart.html">Tree diagrams</a> use authenticity levels
        to make displayed information more obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
        Source also has an <a href="gkhRec_Repo.html">archive</a> property that
        defines where the source is stored. It is worth noting that the archive
        here is not necessarily a state archive or private archive institution,
        but a private document collection or other specific document
        storage.

    <p>
        There is a uniting table on the &quot;Sources&quot; tab of the main
        working window which includes all sources available in the database.
        A source summary to the right of the table shows all information about the
        selected source and links made from other records to this one.
