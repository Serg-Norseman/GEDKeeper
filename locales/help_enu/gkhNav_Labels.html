    <h1>Label for an individual record</h1>

    <p>
        There are two kinds of labels that GEDKeeper uses for a person
        record to make navigation easier: patriarch label and bookmark. They
        are almost identical. Both labels are set up as flags in the person
        modifying dialog. A label is formal and used only to make navigation
        easier when processing a large database.
    </p>

    <p>
        The best practice for using a patriarch label is to label the most
        distant male ancestor in each investigated line (the family founder).
    </p>

    <p>You use a bookmark to label people that are actively being investigated.</p>

    <p>There are two ways to use labels:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Both patriarch labels and bookmarks are visible in the dedicated
            columns in the main person list. Therefore, it is easy to order the
            list using those columns so you can easily find all labeled persons and
            handle them quickly.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can use patriarch label as a filter condition. Thus, you can
            quickly get a short list of ancestors-line founders. And once you have
            found a required one, you can, for example, show his descendants tree
            or generate a pedigree.
        </li>
    </ul>
