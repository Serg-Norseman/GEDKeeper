    <h1>Label for an Individual Record</h1>
    <p>
        There are two kinds of labels that GEDKeeper uses for an individual
        record to make navigation easier: patriarch label and bookmark. These
        are very similar in function. Both are set up as flags in the person
        editing dialog. A label is formal and used only to make navigation
        easier when processing a big database.
    </p>
    <p>
        The best practice for using a patriarch label is to label the most
        distant male ancestor in each investigated line (the family founder).
    </p>
    <p>
        You use a bookmark to identify people that are currently heavily
        researched.
    </p>
    <p>There are two ways to use labels:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Both patriarch labels and bookmarks are visible in the dedicated
            columns in the main person list. Therefore, it is easy to order the
            list using those columns to easily find all labeled persons and
            handle them quickly.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can use a patriarch label as a filter condition. Thus, you can
            quickly get a short list of ancestor founders. Once a required one is found,
            you can, for example, show a descendants tree or generate a pedigree.
        </li>
    </ul>
