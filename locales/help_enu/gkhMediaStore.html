    <h1>Storing Multimedia Content Files</h1>
    <p>There are three ways to store multimedia content within GEDKeeper&#151;each with its&#39; advantages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Using absolute pathname<br />When this method is applied, the database
            only stores a pathname to the directory. When GEDKeeper reads a file, it is opened using
            that pathname. Such a file is completely independent from GEDKeeper&#39;s
            database. This can result in a smaller database size.
            However, moving the database to another system means fixing all broken pathnames.
        </li>
        <li>
            Storing in an archive<br />GEDKeeper creates a ZIP archive file having the same
            name as your database&#151;sharing the same directory with the
            database. All non-multimedia files added to the database are moved into
            this archive. This method has several advantages. One of which is
            having a single data storage medium for all non-multimedia files in the database. It is also
            very easy to move such a database to another system: just
            move the database and its&#39; ZIP archive of the same name. Multimedia
            files (video, music, and photos) are not put into an archive since
            binary (non-text) files have very low compression rates.
        </li>
        <li>
            Using &quot;storage&quot;<br />In this case GEDKeeper creates a new
            directory by your database file (in the same directory with the database
            filename). This new directory has the same name as your database
            filename has. All multimedia files added to the database are
            copied into that directory. Thus, you have centralized file storage
            linked to your database; which is very easy to move to another
            system. You would just move the database file, and subdirectory of the same
            name, to the new systsem.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can use any of the above methods to your preference, but only a single method may be used.</p>
