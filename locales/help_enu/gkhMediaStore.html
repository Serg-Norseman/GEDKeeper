    <h1>Storing multimedia content files</h1>

    <p>
        There are three ways to store multimedia content within GEDKeeper:
        store the file in its' original place and use an absolute pathname as a
        reference, use file &quot;storage&quot; (a directory), or use a file
        archive (ZIP). Each method has its own advantages.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            &quot;Using absolute pathnames&quot;. When this method is applied, the database
            stores only the pathname. When your system reads this file, it is opened using
            that pathname. Such a file is completely independent from the GEDKeeper
            database, so once you have moved the database to another system, it is
            necessary to fix all broken pathnames.
        </li>

        <li>
            &quot;Saving to the store&quot;. In this case, GEDKeeper creates a new
            directory near your database file (in the same directory with the database
            filename). The new directory has the same name as your database
            filename. When you add a multimedia file to the database, this file is
            copied into this directory. Thus, you got a centralized files storage
            linked to your database, which is very easy to be moved to another
            system&mdash;you just copy the database file and its sibling directory of the same
            name.
        </li>

        <!-- Be sure this listitem goes last since it references the above. -->
        <li>
            &quot;Saving to the archive&quot;. GEDKeeper creates a ZIP archive having the same
            name as your database and sharing the same directory.
            Most multimedia files you have added to the database are copied into
            this archive. This method has several advantages. One of which is
            having single data storage for all files in the database. It is also
            very easy to move such a database to another system. You just need to
            move the database itself and the ZIP archive of the same name. You cannot
            add large files (video, music, and photos) into an archive&mdash;it is
            disallowed by GEDKeeper. Large non-text (binary) files have very low compression rates,
            that is why there is no sense to add such files into an archive.
            Such files are treated in the &quot;Saving to the store&quot; method.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can use any or all these methods freely.</p>
