    <h1>Tools: Geographical Locations Management</h1>
    <p>
        This tool puts all references to geographical locations in order for
        a large database. This adds to a reference index, reduces different forms to
        a single one, assign coordinates, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
        The tool scans the entire database and creates a list of all locations
        mentioned in events and facts. Then it orders the list and calculates the
        number of references to each location. If a location already has an
        entry in the reference index, it shows a &#39;[*]&#39; sign in its
        name.
    </p>
    <p>
        To create a new entry in the reference index, you should select a
        location without the &#39;[*]&#39; sign and double-click it. A standard
        dialog appears where you select an entry from an index (in case this
        location already exists but has different name) or where you may add a new
        location. After you have completed entering data, all references to the
        location will be modified according to the reference index.
