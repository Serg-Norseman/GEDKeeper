    <h1>Tools: Manage places</h1>
    <p>
        This tool puts in order all references to geographical locations in
        a database: adds to a reference index, reduces different forms to
        one, assign coordinates, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
        The tool scans the entire database and creates a list of all locations
        mentioned in events and facts. Then it orders the list and calculates the
        number of references to each location. If a location already has an
        entry in the reference index, it will have the &quot;[*]&quot; symbol next to its
        name.
    </p>
    <p>
        To create a new entry in the reference index, you would select a
        location without the &quot;[*]&quot; symbol and double-click it. A standard
        dialog appears where you select an entry from an index (in case this
        location already exists but has different name), or a dialog where you can add a new
        location. After you have completed entering data, all references to the
        location will be modified according to the reference index.
