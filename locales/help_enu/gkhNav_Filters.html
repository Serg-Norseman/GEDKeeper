    <h1>Filtering Person Records</h1>
    <p>
        You use filtering to restrict the number of persons you see at one time.
        The database size grows with each record, so one day you may find it
        difficult to find the person(s) you are looking for. This is when
        filters become extremely useful.
    </p>
    <p>
        To set up the filters you use the <img src="images/iFilter.gif" align="middle">
        toolbar button, the &quot;Edit\Filter&quot; menu, or the hotkey [Ctrl + F].
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two types of filters: standard and additional specific
        filters. Standard filters are used for any type of record in the database;
        it is available on the &quot;Fields filter&quot; tab in the filtering
        dialog. Additional specific filters are used for person records only,
        and are available on the &quot;Specific filter&quot; tab when
        filtering an open person list.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fields filter works identically for all person records. A user selects
        a target field (a column in the database&#39;s list) on which
        the filter will be applied, then add a filter condition and value.
        Several selection criteria may be applied as required.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, you want to select all people with an Ivanov-like last name
        who lived in Samara. To do this, open the filtering dialog, go to the
        filter&#39;s first row, and select &quot;Full name&quot; value in the
        &quot;Field&quot; dropdown list. Set the condition to &quot;Contains&quot;,
        and value to &quot;Ivanov&quot;. Then go to the next filter&#39;s row and
        set field to &quot;Residence&quot;, condition to &quot;Contains&quot;,
        and value to &quot;Samara&quot;.
    </p>
    <p>
        Specific filtration is used to improve performance and work
        efficiently while handling person records. Such a filter has the following
        selection criterions: sex, is a person alive, patriarch&#39;s bookmarks, all
        name parts, residence, events, groups, and sources. There
        are <a href="gkhMasks.html">masks</a> available when one is filtering
        by name, life events, or residence.
    </p>
    <p>
        When processing person records, a user can use simple filters along
        with additional specific filters.
