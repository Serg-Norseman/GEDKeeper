    <h1>Filtering records</h1>
    <p>
        You use filtering to limit the number of persons you see at once.
        Since the database size grows with each new record, eventually one day you may find it very
        difficult to find the person you need. Here is where filters come in handy.
    </p>
    <p>
        To set up the filters you use the <img src="images/iFilter.gif">
        toolbar button, the &quot;Edit\Filter&quot; menu,
        or use the [<kbd>Ctrl + F</kbd>] hotkey.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two types of filters: standard and additional specific
        filters. Standard filters are used for any type of record in the database.
        It is available on the &quot;Fields filter&quot; tab in the filtering
        dialog. Additional specific filters are used for person records only
        and are available on the &quot;Specific filter&quot; tab; when you are
        filtering an already opened person list.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fields filter work identically on any person records. You select
        a target field (a column in the database's list) on which you are about
        to apply the filter, then add the filter condition and value. You can apply
        several selection criterions when it is necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, let's assume you want to select all people with an Johnson-like last name
        who lived in Springfield. To do this, open the filtering dialog, go to the
        filter's first row and select &quot;Full name&quot; in the
        &quot;Field&quot; dropdown list. Set the condition to &quot;Contains&quot;,
        and the value to &quot;Johnson&quot;. Then go to the next filters row and
        set the field to &quot;Residence&quot;, the condition to &quot;Contains&quot;,
        and value to &quot;Springfield&quot;. This should look like:

    </p>
    <p>
        Specific filtration is used to improve performance and work
        efficiently while handling person records. Such a filter has the following
        selection criterions: sex, is a person alive, patriarch's bookmarks, all
        name parts, residence and events, and groups and sources. There
        are <a href="gkhMasks.html">masks</a> available when one is filtering
        by name, life events, or residence.
    </p>
    <p>
        When processing person records, you can use simple filters along
        with additional specific filters.
