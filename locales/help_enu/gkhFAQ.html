<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<dl>
<dt>1. Can I have thousands of people in my database?</dt>
<dd>Theoretically GEDKeeper does not have a limit to the number of records that can be stored. Performance may be impacted with larger databases (e.g., tens of thousands of records). This may be addressed in a future release.</dd>

<dt>2. Can I add source references to each person, family, and event?</dt>
<dd>There are no limits when attaching source references to a person, family, or event&#151;including cases and other objects. In addition, references to sources may be grouped by archives.</dd>

<dt>3. I need to record data about unrelated persons who lived in a single community and were perhaps related to each other in the past, but was not revealed quickly. Can I do this with GEDKeeper?</dt>
<dd>GEDKeeper can store an unlimited number of unrelated persons.</dd>

<dt>4. Can I print or export data from GEDKeeper to some commonly used formats?</dt>
<dd>The following are options for data exporting:
<p>a) Three types of trees: ancestors, descendants, and combined. Other types may be implemented in a future
release if such requests continue to increase. GEDKeeper can print trees itself, and you can 
export a tree to a graphics file (JPG, SVG, or WMF) then print that file from an external application.</p>

<p>b) Export a list of persons to an Excel workbook. Currently there are not many settings for export tuning and selecting exported information, but this will evolve as needed.</p>

<p>c) Export a persons&#39; statistical data with cataloging&#151;in several Web-centric formats.</p>

<p>d) Create pedigrees having two schemes of numbering: d&#39;Aboville and Konovalov. Such pedigrees 
are created as HTML, PDF, or RTF files which may be viewed by a third-party viewer. For example, 
<a href="https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/wiki" target="_blank">SumatraPDF</a> and <a href="https://www.adobe.com/reader" target="_blank">Adobe Reader</a> can print such 
files. Generated files have hyperlinks for main directions. Optionally you can add references to sources and notes into the generated files.</p>

<p>e) Create Google-maps with markers for places of birth and death&#151;for any number of people stored in the database. Printing these maps may be implemented in a future release.</p>
</dd>

<dt>5. Can I import data from other applications using the GEDCOM format?</dt>
<dd>Yes, importing GEDCOM-formatted data is fully supported. GEDCOM is the native data format for GEDKeeper. GEDKeeper uses extensions within the format&#151;retaining full GEDCOM compatiblity.
Therefore, you may also export data from GEDKeeper to other software supporting GEDCOM.
The list of extensions are: groups for quick and vivid joining of unrelated persons, objects: &quot;research&quot;, &quot;task&quot;, and &quot;communication&quot; (to store correspondence archive, creating and tracking tasks, and researches).</dd>

<dt>6. How can I create a list of persons grouped by a property (sex, age, place, or social status) as defined in a source?</dt>
<dd>To create such lists you can use one of the following methods:

<p>a) Sort a list by clicking a column header. Ascending or descending order sorting is implemented in all lists. This includes age, sex, and
place of residence columns.</p>

<p>b) Sort on an individual part of a name. To accomplish this, the &quot;full name&quot; column is divided into three separate columns using the &quot;Edit\Options...&quot; menu
to change how a name is shown in lists to split on individual components.</p>

<p>c) Filter on content. You can use filter on the following object properties: sex, live&#47;died attribute, &quot;patriarch&quot; attribute, logical group of people, name, and
place of residence. When filtering by name or place you can use special meta-characters to search by &quot;mask&quot;: the &#39;*&#39; symbol matches any number of any characters and the
&#39;?&#39; symbol matches any single character. In this way a &quot;Sm*&quot; filter matches any name starting with &quot;Sm&quot; while &quot;*sm*&quot; matches any name having &quot;sm&quot; within the name.
Compound filters use the &quot;OR&quot; conjunction symbol. For example, &quot;*jo*|*sm*&quot; matches any name with &quot;jo&quot; or &quot;sm&quot; inside the name.</p>

<p>d) Use groups. You can sort by a group and apply a filter by a group then view a group&#39;s members when you have selected the group in its native list.
A person may have several social or other type of groups.</p>
</dd>

<dt>7. Can GEDKeeper shows empty dates on death and birth events as &quot;?&quot; in lists?</dt>
<dd>This is not currently implemented. However, this may be implemented in a future release as an optional feature. Numerous tests revealed that such behavior clutters the main lists up.
If we receive enough requests for this feature we will likely implement it.</dd>

<dt>8. Can you improve the new person adding feature by implementing an &quot;Apply and continue&quot; button?</dt>
<dd>A similar feature is implemented by the plug-in that can be accessed through the &quot;Plug-ins\Continuous data adding&quot; menu. This plug-in gives the ability to add minimal
information about a person while handling large numbers of people. You could add main information for each person&#151;postponing secondary data, such as relationships, until a future time.</dd>
