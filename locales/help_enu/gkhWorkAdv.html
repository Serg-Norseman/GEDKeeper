    <h1>Tips and Tricks for Advanced Use</h1>
    <h3>Data input</h3>
    <p>
        If a large number of individuals are to be added to the database from an
        audit tale or a register of births, and you are sure that none of the
        added individuals already exists in your database, you should create a
        source record first, and then use that source as a person filter. After
        you completing those steps, you can start to add new data. Each new
        person will get the source automatically. It makes providing a correct
        source for a person simple&#151;all you need is to add page numbers
        and authenticity index for person reference in a source. If you add an
        individual who already exists in your database, you have two possible
        solutions: to not filter the content, or use the merging duplicates
        tool after you completed data entering.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a specialized plug-in provided with GEDKeeper called
        &quot;Streamed data input&quot;, that allows adding of data from audit tales
        and a register of births. Using this plug-in requires entered data in a format
        that is very close to the one used in the sources. Be aware that
        this plug-in is currently experimental. As such, it is not supported and
        further development is unlikely. Therefore, there is no guarantee on the
        stability of this plug-in.
    </p>
    <p>
        Starting from version 2.3 GEDKeeper has an image viewer plug-in. It
        becomes useful when you need to simultaneously work with a photo or
        scanned page of a document and a database. To perform this you need to
        open a database then open the image viewer plug-in by clicking the
        &quot;Windows&#47;Vertical tile&quot; menu item. After this, both
        windows lay themselves out in a  useful manner. The image viewer
        plug-in is a very simple image viewer, but it has enough functionality for
        the mode of operation described above. You can zoom and pan an image.
        There is one distinct advantage to using this plug-in over external third party
        image viewer software. When using GEDKeeper on a large monitor or on
        a multi-monitor configuration, you do not have to switch between
        applications or be careful not to press one of many hotkeys, used in
        external software, that may change the image appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you process a source and know that your large database already
        has the person being processed, you can use the &quot;Time line&quot; plug-in to
        quickly find that person. After moving the &quot;slider&quot; to the
        desired year, you get a list of individuals who were alive in that year.
        When this technique is combined with location or name filters, you can
        speed up data processing noticeably.
    </p>
    <h3>Data Processing</h3>
    <p>
        When continuously processing large databases, you may want to use the
        &quot;Check family connectivity&quot; and &quot;Database check&quot;
        tools. The former discovers data fragmentation: it shows all unrelated
        groups of person records. Sometimes this reveals errors made at the
        time of heavy work, when a person was disjoined from a family, but was
        not attached to another one. Thus, such a person remains
        &quot;free&quot;. Database check discovers all errors or
        inconsistencies in the database. Currently there is little criteria.
        When used, this tool reveals erroneous years of birth in
        families (when one of the parents or their descendants have an incorrect year
        and age differences are less than a reasonable limit). Another
        example is heavy work with sources frequently that ends up with empty family
        records. GEDKeeper does not remove such records automatically, but this
        tool finds it and provides the option to remove the records from the database.
    </p>
    <h3>Text Handling</h3>
    <p>
        You can use the <img src="images/iCopy.gif" align="middle"> button in the
        person editor window to a copy person&#39;s full name to the
        clipboard.
    </p>
    <p>
        Text fields for names in the first small window for person adding
        can change the case of the first letter in a name. This also removes leading and
        trailing spaces in the text. To use this function just press the [ Ctrl + Down ]
        hotkey while you are in a text field.
