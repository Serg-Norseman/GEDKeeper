    <h3>Data input</h3>
    <p>
        If you need to add to the database a large number of individuals from a
        census or a register of births, and you are sure that not one of the
        added individuals already exists in your database, you can create a
        source record first, and then use that source as a person filter. After
        completing those steps, you can start to add new data. Each new
        person will get the source automatically. It makes providing a correct
        source for a person easier&#151;all you need is to add page numbers
        and an authenticity index for the person reference in a source. If you add an
        individual who already exists in your database, you have two possible
        solutions: not filtering the content, and using the <a href="gkhTools_DubsMerge.html">merge duplicates</a>
        tool after completing the data entry.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a specialized plugin provided with GEDKeeper,
        &quot;Stream input&quot;, that allows adding data from censuses
        and registers of births. Using this plugin you enter data in a format
        that is very close to the one used in the sources. Please remember that
        this plugin is currently an experiment; it is not supported and not being
        developed; we do not guarantee stable work of this plugin.
    </p>
    <p>
        Starting from version 2.3, GEDKeeper has an image viewer plugin. It
        becomes useful when you need to simultaneously work with a photo or
        scanned page of a document and the database. To work this way, you need to
        open a database, open image viewer plugin and
        vertically align the two windows.
        The image viewer
        plugin is a very simple image viewer, but it has enough functionality for
        this mode of operation. You can zoom and pan the image.
        There is one distinct advantage of this plugin over external third party
        image viewer software: when you use GEDKeeper on a large monitor or on
        a multi-monitor configuration, you do not have to switch between
        applications or be careful not to press one of many hotkeys used in
        an external software, that may change the current image appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you process a source and know that your large database already
        has the person being processed, you can use the <a href="gkhSvc_TimeLine.html">Time line</a> plugin to
        quickly find that person. After you move the &quot;slider&quot; to the
        necessary year, you get a list of individuals who were alive in that year.
        When this technique is combined with location or name filters, you can
        speed up data processing noticeably.
    </p>
    <h3>Data processing</h3>
    <p>
        When you continuously process large databases, you may need the
        <a href="gkhTools_FamiliesConnectivity.html">Check connection of families</a> and <a href="gkhTools_TreeCheck.html">Check database</a>
        tools. The former discovers data fragmentation: it shows all unrelated
        groups of person records. Sometimes this reveals errors made at the
        time of heavy work, when a person was disjoined from a family, but was
        not attached to another one. Thus, such a person remains
        &quot;free&quot;. The Check database tool discovers all logical errors and
        inconsistencies in the database. There is little criteria currently,
        but, for example, this tool reveals erroneous years of birth in
        families (when one of the parents or their descendants have an incorrect year
        and age differences are less than a reasonable limit). Another
        example, heavy work with sources may end up with empty family
        records. GEDKeeper does not remove such records automatically, but this
        tool finds it and can remove the records from database at your prompting.
    </p>
    <h3>Tips and tricks for easy handling</h3>
    <p>
        You can use the <img src="images/iCopy.gif"> button in the
        person editor window to copy a person&#39;s full name to the
        clipboard.
    </p>
    <p>
        Text fields for names in the first, small window for person adding,
        can change case of the first letter in a name and remove leading and
        trailing spaces in text. To use those function just press the [<kbd>Ctrl + Down</kbd>]
        hotkey while you are in a text field.
