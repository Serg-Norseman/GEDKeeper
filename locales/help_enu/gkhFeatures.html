    <h1>Advantages and Features</h1>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>GEDKeeper is a freeware, open-source product without advertisements.</li>
            <li>It is a cross-platform project; one can build a release for Linux or Microsoft Windows&trade; operating systems.</li>
            <li>GEDKeeper does not limit data size.</li>
            <li>Main functions are always improving; the kernel is continuously developed and tested. We always seek new ways to improve program reliability and performance.</li>
            <li>Wholesome conservatism of the user interface. The author does not change the GUI at each release&#151;we do not follow new trends blindly.</li>
            <li>GEDKeeper can be easily extended: it supports scripts and <a href="gkhPlugins.html" target="_self">plug-ins</a>. Any user familiar with programming in VB.NET or C# can create a plug-in.</li>
            <li>GEDKeeper supports several <a href="gkhLangs.html" target="_self">localizations</a>. Any user can create a localization for a native language.</li>
            <li>Author emphasizes maximum improvement of navigation and search over information in very big data structures of genealogical information (filtering, search, and navigation).</li>
            <li>GEDKeeper does not utilize genealogical social networks, databases, or cloud services. You are never forced to save data to such storage mediums.</li>
            <li>GEDKeeper guarantees data safety and integrity in case of possible system errors.</li>
            <li>
                You have the freedom in choosing how to process tree and pedigree images. Tree and pedigree images may be exported into a file, then optionally
                processed, or printed, by third party software. Note: GEDKeeper does provide some printing features.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>Disadvantages compared with other open-source, non-profit, and commercial software</h4>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>GEDKeeper does not have a beautiful and stylish interface. It is being built with functionality and performance in mind.</li>
            <li>GEDKeeper has minimal help content. There are comparativly few users providing material for updated help content.</li>
            <li>A dedicated website does not exist for an Internet presence.</li>
            <li>
                Import of third-party GEDCOM files is being implemented slowly. There is good news: GEDKeeper handles such foreign GEDCOM data
                very carefully and never loses unknown data structures. While some data may not be shown, they are always saved as-is (see the &quot;Features&quot; section below).
            </li>
            <li>
                There have been claims that GEDKeeper is inflexible. Once it is recognized that the ideology of GEDKeeper is to be a
                laconic tool for gathering, processing ,and searching information while
                performing long and broad genealogical research, such claims become unwarranted.
                The author, for example, has more than 70 research branches in his database used to investigate all possible relatives.
                Most third-party solutions for tree visualization provide little for effective
                processing--although they may provide beautiful diagrams. The author and other users work with all
                the diagrams implemented in GEDKeeper&#151;satisfying their requirements in an efficient and clear way of work.
                Since this is open source software, the author encourages others to create plug-ins to
                extend GEDKeeper functionality.

        </ul>

    <h3>Features</h3>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>GEDKeeper supports nearly all of the GEDCOM specification v5.5.1.</li>
            <li>
                GEDKeeper uses extensions to the GEDCOM
                specification to store and process social groups, researches, tasks, and
                correspondence. Much genealogical software have such extensions but
                unfortunately they are all non-standard. There were repeated attempts
                undertaken in the past to develop a new GEDCOM specification to include
                these extensions, but all attempts thus far have failed.
            </li>
            <li>
                A non-standard European extension for storing notes and references to geographical locations with coordinates is provided.
            </li>
            <li>GEDKeeper saves data using extensions to the GEDCOM standard&#151;yet it retains full compliance.</li>
            <li>GEDKeeper primarily targets Russian users. Therefore some functions, such as one which handles names, lack some flexability
                that may not meet the requirements of non-Russian users.</li>
            <li>
                Currently GEDKeeper does not store data in a relational database.
                Experiments performed by the author revealed that a relational database having less
                than 500,000 person records did not demonstrate benefits in either performance or usability. If a relational
                database becomes a necessity then only freeware products will be chosen&#151;such as
                SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Firebird, or perhaps Berkeley DB.
            </li>
            <li>
                The GEDCOM specification defines two equivalent ways to store internal
                references to multimedia content, notes, and sources: local storage in the
                form of an event object and as a full-fledged record&#151;paired to other types
                of records like persons and families. GEDKeeper uses the latter
                and converts, as needed, any GEDCOM file which comes from an
                external source. This instantly makes all notes, multimedia content, and
                sources available for viewing and navigation. Thus the user can see what
                records reference those objects.
