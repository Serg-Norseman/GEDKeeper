    <h1>Advantages, Disadvantages, and Features</h1>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>GEDKeeper is a freeware, open-source product with no advertisements.</li>
        <li>GEDKeeper supports both Linux and Windows. It is a cross-platform project&mdash;one can build a release on Linux or the Windows operating systems.</li>
        <li>GEDKeeper doesn't limit data size.</li>
        <li>Main functions are always being improved&mdash;such as the kernel which is continuously developed and tested. We always seek new ways to improve program reliability and performance.</li>
        <li>Wholesome conservatism for the user interface. The author does not change the GUI from version-to-version each time, following all new trends blindly.</li>
        <li>GEDKeeper can be easily extended: it supports scripts and plugins. Any user comfortable with programming in VB.NET or C# can create a plugin.</li>
        <li>GEDKeeper supports several localizations. Anyone can create a localization for the program for their native language.</li>
        <li>The author emphasizes maximum improvement of navigation and search over information in very big data arrays of genealogical information (filtering, search, and navigation).</li>
        <li>
            GEDKeeper does not integrate with genealogical social networks, databases, or cloud services, and never forces
            users to save their data to such storages.
        </li>
        <li>GEDKeeper guarantees data safety and integrity in case of possible system errors.</li>
        <li>
            You have the freedom in choosing how to process tree and pedigree
            images.You can export tree and pedigree pictures into a file and
            then perform some optional processing of the file in a third-party tool&mdash;before
            printing the file with the help of that tool-chain. Also,
            GEDKeeper provides built-in services for printing documents (which may be
            less flexible than specialized third-party tools).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Features</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            GEDKeeper almost completely meets the full requirements of the GEDCOM
            specification version 5.5.1. Unfortunately, this specification does not have a complete definition of what constitutes an extension data structure.
            Nevertheless, GEDKeeper includes a compliant European extension for
            storing notes and references to geographical locations with
            coordinates.
        </li>
        <li>
            GEDKeeper itself adds compliant extensions to the GEDCOM
            specification to store and process social groups, researches, tasks and
            correspondence. Most genealogical software have such extensions but
            unfortunately, they are all custom (non-compliant). There were repeated attempts
            undertaken in the past to develop a new GEDCOM specification to include
            these extensions, but all attempts have failed. Without a new specification each developer may make extensions in unique ways,
            whereas GEDKeeper provides a framework to create extensions.
        </li>
        <li>
            GEDKeeper cannot save its database to meet the pure GEDCOM
            specification without using extensions. No one has required this
            feature during the lifetime of GEDKeeper.
        </li>
        <li>
            GEDKeeper primarily targets Russian users, therefore some
            functions, for example, one that handles names, are not flexible enough
            and could not meet requirements of non-Russian users.
        </li>
        <li>
            Currently GEDKeeper does not store data in a relational database.
            Experiments made by the author revealed that with databases having less
            than 500,000 person records, relational database do not give any
            benefits in performance or usability when compared to the
            currently implemented data storing. Having many related questions, it is necessary
            to emphasize that this software will never support storing data in a
            commercial relational database&mdash;like desktop MS Access or
            client-server Oracle, Sybase, or MS SQL Server. If a relational
            database becomes a necessity only freeware products may be chosen&mdash;like
            SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Firebird and, maybe, Berkeley
            DB.
        </li>
        <li>
            The GEDCOM specification defines two equivalent ways to store internal
            references to multimedia content, notes, and sources: local storage in the
            form of an event object and as full-fledged records, paired to other types
            of records like persons and families. GEDKeeper uses only the latter,
            and converts, on-the-fly, any GEDCOM file when opening from an
            external source. This instantly makes all notes, multimedia content, and
            sources available for viewing and navigation, and you can see what
            records reference those objects.
