    <h1>Tools: Compare databases</h1>

    <p>There are two types of comparison available: &quot;internal comparing&quot; and &quot;compare with another database&quot;.</p>

    <p>
        The internal comparison searches for possible duplication of person
        records. There are some criteria to find similar or identical people. It
        is worth noting that this compare may give a false positive&mdash;especially
        in cases of past centuries when two or more children in a
        single family had the same name. That is, GEDKeeper does not explicitly
        filter out brothers and sisters with the same name.
    </p>

    <p>
        Database compare checks person records from two different databases.
        The comparison shows equal family names and people with equal full names
        from both databases in dedicated lists. For your information and
        further analysis, the lists show birth date and death date for those
        people. This compare is useful when you need to find possible
        matches in different databases.
