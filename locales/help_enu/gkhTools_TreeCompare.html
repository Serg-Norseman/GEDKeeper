    <h1>Tools: Databases Compare</h1>
    <p>
        There are two types of comparisons available: internal comparison and
        comparing with an external database.
    </p>
    <p>
        Internal comparison searches for possible duplicates of person
        records. There are some criteria to find similar or identical people. It
        is worth noting that this comparison may give a false positive&#151;especially
        in cases of past centuries when two or more children of
        single family had the same name. That is, GEDKeeper explicitly does not
        filter out brothers and sisters with the same name.
    </p>
    <p>
        The external database comparison checks person records of two different databases.
        The comparison shows equal family names and people with equal full names
        from both databases in dedicated lists. For your information and
        further analysis, the lists display birth date and death date for those
        people. This comparison is useful when you need to find possible
        matches in different databases.
