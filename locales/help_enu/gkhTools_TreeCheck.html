    <h1>Tools: Check database</h1>

    <p>
        This tool checks information correctness in the database. It checks two
        types of records: family and person. Unlike typical database integrity
        checking, which is run every time you open a database and which checks
        the database structure, this tool handles logical errors and data
        inaccuracy.
    </p>

    <p>
        To pass the check, a family record must have assigned husband, wife,
        children, and events. When an empty family is found, the tool proposes
        to remove it. It is normal in practice to create a family from
        people, which might later be discovered, are from different
        families and were added erroneously. In these cases, GEDKeeper can
        move people from one family to another. After such actions a family record
        may lose all relations. This is a likely situation when you actively
        process large amounts of information.
    </p>

    <p>
        A person record is checked in the following way: the tool checks the
        death event, taking the maximal, scientifically confirmed age into
        account, checks and notifies about people without an explicitly defined
        sex, notifies about incorrect lifetime dates (for example, death date
        is before birth date), notifies about persons that were married before
        or after reasonable limits, or that have children who were born out of
        reasonable limits.
        When a person has no sex, the tool marks the record as being
        changed and opens the sex editor dialog. When a person&#39;s age exceeds
        the maximum one, the tool adds a death event without a specified date to the
        person record.
    </p>

    <p>
        GEDKeeper fixes the lack of a death event, lack of a sex declaration, and may
        remove empty family records. All other issues are shown only for your
        information.
