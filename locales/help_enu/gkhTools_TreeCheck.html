    <h1>Tools: Database Check</h1>
    <p>
        This tool checks information correctness in a database. It checks two
        types of records: family and person. Unlike the usual database integrity
        checking, which runs every time a database is opened to check
        the database itself, this tool handles logical errors and data
        inaccuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
        To pass the check, a family record must have an assigned husband, wife,
        children, and events. When an empty family is found, the tool proposes
        to remove it. It is normal practice to create a family from
        people, which as it will be discovered later, are from different
        families and maybe added erroneously. In these cases, GEDKeeper can easily
        move a person from one family to another. After such actions a family record
        may lose all relations. This is a very likely situation when you actively
        process large amounts of information.
    </p>
    <p>
        A person record is checked as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>If the death event is checked, you are notified if the date is outside the maximal, scientifically confirmed age limit.</li>
            <li>Notifies about people without an explicitly defined sex.</li>
            <li>Notifies about incorrect lifetime dates (for example, death date is before birth date).</li>
            <li>Notifies about persons that were married before or after reasonable limits.</li>
            <li>Notifies about children that are not born within reasonable limits.</li>
        </ul>
        When a person has no identified sex, the record is marked as being
        changed and opens the sex editor dialog. When a person&#39;s age exceeds
        the maximum, the tool will add a death event, without a specified date, to the
        person record.
    </p>
    <p>
        GEDKeeper fixes the lack of a death event and sex only. Under some conditions
        empty family records are removed. Any other issues are displayed for your
        information only.
