    <h1>Tools: Databases Merger</h1>
    <p>
        This tool directly merges one database with another one. All
        records from one database are copied to the other database. No records are
        modified. Relations are not modified either.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is good practice to run the &quot;search duplicates&quot; tool after
        completing a merge. Especially since both databases may have information
        about identical persons.
