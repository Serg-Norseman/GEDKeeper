    <h1>Tools: Merge databases</h1>
    <p>
        This tool merges a separate database into the one you are currently working with (the &quot;master&quot;).
        All records are copied intact&#151;no records are modified or merged.
        Relations are not modified either.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is a good practice to run the &quot;search duplicates&quot; tool after this
        one. This is especially important when both databases have information about the same
        persons.
