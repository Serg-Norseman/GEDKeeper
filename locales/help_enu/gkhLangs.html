    <h1>Localization</h1>

    <p>
        GEDKeeper has multi-language support. You can use, for example, the
        Russian localization, or another one, at your preference. You can change the user
        interface localization by using &quot;Service\Options&quot; on the
        &quot;Common&quot; tab. The interface language is changed immediately&#151;restarting
        the application is unnecessary.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can contribute to the project by translating the user interface into your native language.
        All it takes is copying the most appropriate &quot;.lng&quot; file from the &quot;locales&quot; project subdirectory and email the
        translated file to the author of GEDKeeper. After validation, your file will be included in the next GEDKeeper release.
