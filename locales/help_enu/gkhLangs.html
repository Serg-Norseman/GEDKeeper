<h1>Localization</h1>

<p>GEDKeeper has multilanguage support. You can use, for example,
the Russian localization or another one at your option. You can change the user
interface localization using &quot;Service\Options&quot; on the
&quot;Common&quot; tab. The interface language is changed immediately&#151;you
do not have to restart the application.</p>

<p>Also, you can contribute to the project by translating the user interface into your native language. Just translate the 
most suitable &quot;<samp>lng</samp>&quot; file from the &quot;<samp>locales</samp>&quot; project subdirectory and email the
translated file to the author of GEDKeeper. After validation, your file will be included in the next GEDKeeper release.</p>
