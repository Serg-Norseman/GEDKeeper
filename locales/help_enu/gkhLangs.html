    <h1>Localization</h1>

    <p>
        GEDKeeper has multilanguage support. You can use, for example,
        the Russian localization or another one at your option. You can change the user
        interface localization using &quot;Service\Options&quot; on the
        &quot;Common&quot; tab. The interface language is changed immediately&#151;you
        do not have to restart the application.
    </p>

    <p>
        Currently the program is translated into the following languages:

        <ul>
            <li>Russian [rus]
            <li>English [enu]
            <li>Ukrainian [ukr]
            <li>Polish [pol]
            <li>Italian [ita]
            <li>Chinese (simplified) [zho]
            <li>French [fra]
            <li>German [deu]
            <li>Czech [cze]
            <li>Kazakh (cyrillic), partial [kaz]
        </ul>
    </p>

        Also, you can contribute to the project by translating the user interface into your native language. Just translate the
        most suitable &quot;<samp>lng</samp>&quot; file from the &quot;<samp>locales</samp>&quot; project subdirectory and email the
        translated file to the author of GEDKeeper. After validation, your file will be included in the next GEDKeeper release.
