    <h1>Tools: Split database</h1>

    <p>
        Usually, you split your database when you need to completely remove
        some persons or families from the database, you need to make a copy
        of those persons or families to move data to another database, or you
        need to send them to other researchers.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before you run this tool, you must select a person you want to copy
        in the person list on &quot;Individuals&quot; tab. Then you use one of four
        available methods in this tool: pick out all relations, pick out
        ancestors only, pick out descendants only, or family only. When all
        persons have been picked out, you can save them as a separate database
        file, or remove them all from the current database. You can combine
        these operations&mdash;that is, save the picked results to a database first, and
        then remove it from the current database with the &quot;Delete&quot; button.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are two lists displayed when using this tool: the list on the
        left contains all the picked persons, and the list on the right contains persons
        that were not picked by the tool.
