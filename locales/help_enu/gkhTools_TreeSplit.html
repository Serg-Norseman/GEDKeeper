    <h1>Tools: Database Splitting</h1>
    <p>
        Often a database is split when you need to completely remove
        some persons or families, you need to make a copy
        of those persons or families to move data to another database, or you
        need to send them to other researchers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before you run this tool, you must select a person you want to copy
        in the person list on the &quot;Persons&quot; tab. Then you use one of four
        available methods in this tool: pick out all relations, pick out
        ancestors only, pick out descendants only, or family only. When all
        persons have been picked out, you can save them as a separate database
        file, or remove them from the current database. These
        operations may be combined to save picked results as a database at first, then
        remove the results from the current database.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two lists in the user interface of this tool: a list on the
        left contains all picked persons, and a list on the right contains persons
        that were not picked by the tool.
