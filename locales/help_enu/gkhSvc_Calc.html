    <h1>Calculator</h1>
    <p>
        GEDKeeper has an easy-to-use calculator, that allows you to evaluate
        expression using general mathematical operations and temporary
        variables.
    </p>
    <p>
        This calculator can be useful when needing to process bulk
        information sources; for example, censuses or confessional books.
        You can work with the calculator and other windows side-by-side.
        Therefore, you can drag-and-drop a calculation result
        into a date field within the event editor dialog. Thus, while
        processing a source, you can enter the expression &quot;1896-56&quot; into
        the calculator (a year in a source &quot;-&quot; a persons' age
        &quot;=&quot; year of birth), press [<kbd>Enter</kbd>] to calculate, and then drag the result into a date
        field (the result is treated as a year).
    </p>
    <p>
        If the &quot;Copy result to clipboard&quot; option is checked, the result is copied
        to the clipboard after the [<kbd>Enter</kbd>] key is pressed.
