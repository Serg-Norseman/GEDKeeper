    <h1>Calculator</h1>
    <p>
        GEDKeeper has an easy-to-use calculator that allows you to evaluate
        expressions using common mathematical operations and temporary
        variables.
    </p>
    <p>
        This calculator is very useful when bulk
        information sources must be processed. For example, with audit tales,
        confessional books, or census reports.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can work with the calculator and other windows simultaneously.
        Therefore, for example, you can drag a calculation result and drop it
        into a date field inside the event editor dialog. Thus, while you are
        processing a source, you can enter an expression of &quot;1896-56&quot; into
        the calculator (a year in a source &quot;-&quot; person age
        &quot;=&quot; year of birth), and then drag the result into a date
        field (the result is treated as year).
