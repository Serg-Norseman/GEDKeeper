    <h1>Calculator</h1>

    <p>
        GEDKeeper has an easy-to-use calculator, that allows you to evaluate
        expression using general mathematical operations and temporary variables.
    </p>

    <p>
        This calculator can be useful when needing to process bulk information sources; for example, censuses or confessional books.
        You can work with the calculator and other windows side-by-side.
        Therefore, you can drag-and-drop a calculation result into a date field within the event editor dialog.
        Thus, while processing a source, you can enter the expression &quot;1896-56&quot; into
        the calculator (a year in a source &quot;-&quot; a persons' age &quot;=&quot; year of birth),
        press [<kbd>Enter</kbd>] to calculate, and then drag the result into a date field (the result is treated as a year).
    </p>

    <p>
        If the &quot;Copy result to clipboard&quot; option is checked, the result is copied
        to the clipboard after the [<kbd>Enter</kbd>] key is pressed.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you check the box "Events year calculation",
        then when the <a href="gkhRec_Event.html">events dialog</a> is open at the same time,
        the result will be automatically copied to the date field.
