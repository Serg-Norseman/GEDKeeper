    <h1>Tools: Pedigrees Import</h1>
    <p>Attention:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An import processes pedigrees in text format only.</li>
        <li>A person must be identified by Konovalov&#39;s scheme.</li>
        <li>A person identifier and its name must be delimited by a period (for example, &quot;2-1. Daniel Garner&quot;).</li>
        <li>The name must have the following format: &quot;First_name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronymic" target="_blank">Patronymic_name</a> Last_name&quot;.</li>
        <li>The sex of the person is determined by typical features of the Russian language&#39;s woman names, on names reference index, and, in all other cases, on user decision (via prompting).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <b>A recommendation:</b> perform several imports and check
        the results after each one. If you find an error, modify the original
        text. For example, frequently birthdays inside a row with a name are not
        marked with the &quot;*&quot; symbol. It is impossible to recognize such
        situations programmatically; this may increase the number of false
        positives. Moreover, the name may contain name variants enclosed in
        parentheses, without parentheses, or with the &quot;?&quot; indicator. It is
        impossible to recognize these situations by GEDKeeper. It is
        better to extract such data, and various date formats, to a text block
        after the row with the name.
