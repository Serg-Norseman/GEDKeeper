    <h1>Tools: Import pedigrees</h1>

    <p>Characteristics of the input file:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Import processes pedigrees in text format only.</li>
        <li>Each person must be identified by the <a href="gkhPedigrees.html#Konovalov">Konovalov</a> scheme.</li>
        <li>The person identifier and its name must be delimited by a period (for example, &quot;2-1. Daniel Garner&quot;).</li>
        <li>Name must have the following format: &quot;First_name Patronymic_name Last_name&quot;.</li>
        <li>
            The person's sex is determined based on typical features of the Russian
            language&#39;s woman names on the names reference index, and in all other
            cases on responding to a prompt.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <b>A recommendation:</b> Create a temporary database and make several import attempts and check
        the results after each attempt. If you find an error, modify the original
        text. For example, frequently birthdays inside a row with a name are not
        marked with the &quot;*&quot; symbol. It is impossible to recognize such
        situations programmatically&mdash;this would increase the number of false
        positives. Moreover, a name may contain name variants enclosed in
        parentheses, without parentheses, or with the &quot;?&quot; symbol. It is
        impossible to recognize these with a simple algorithm. It is
        better to extract such data, and various date formats, to a text block
        after the row with a name.
