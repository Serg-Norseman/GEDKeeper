    <h1>Geographical location record</h1>
    <p>
        Geographical location records are elements of the single location
        directory, where each location has its coordinates. When you
        define a location for <a href="gkhRec_Event.html">event&#47;fact</a> in
        <a href="gkhRec_Individual.html">person</a> and <a href="gkhRec_Family.html">family</a> record, you can do this without
        referring to the location directory. But if you want to be able to see
        the location on <a href="gkhMaps.html">geographical maps</a> in the
        future, you have to have to add a location record to the location
        directory&#151;find a settlement on Google Maps and bind the
        location&#39;s coordinates.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can add text notes or multimedia objects (for example, a photo) to a
        geographical location.
    </p>
    <p>To assign coordinates to a location do the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Enter the locations' exact name or one of the possible names to the
            &quot;Name&quot; field (it is advisable to specify the modern name, because
            Google Maps knows nothing about historical names of settlements).
        </li>
        <li>
            Click the &quot;Search&quot; button. GEDKeeper will connect with Google
            Maps and search for the location in Google&#39;s databases.
        </li>
        <li>
            When you see the location you require in the &quot;Search
            coordinates&quot; list, you can click the &quot;Use coordinates&quot; button to
            assign latitude and longitude of the found location to the target one. Alternatively,
            you can click &quot;Use name&quot; to assign Google Map&#39;s name of the
            location or define the name yourself.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the &quot;Search coordinates&quot; list does not have a
            matching location, you have to change the location name and search again.
            Repeat this until you find a required location.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you still cannot find a matching result, you should assign
            latitude and longitude of the necessary location yourself&#151;or find the
            nearest location to the required one, using the steps above, and
            use that location.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The &quot;Show&quot; button opens Google Maps at the specified
        location.
    </p>
    <p align="center"><img src="images/dlgPlaceEdit.gif"></p>

    <p>
        There is a uniting table on the &quot;Locations&quot; tab of the
        main working window, which includes all locations available in the
        database. A location summary to the right of the table shows all events,
        connected to persons and families, that refer to the selected
        location.
