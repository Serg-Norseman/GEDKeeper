    <h1>Geographical Location Record</h1>
    <p>
        Geographical location records are elements of the single location
        database directory&#151;where each location has a set of coordinates. When a
        location is defined for an <a href="gkhRec_Event.html">event&#47;fact</a> in a
        <a href="gkhRec_Individual.html">person</a> or <a href="gkhRec_Family.html">family</a> record,is is referring to
        the location directory. But if you want to be able to see
        the location on <a href="gkhMaps.html">geographical maps</a> in the
        future, you have to have to add a location record to the location
        database directory&#151;find a settlement on Google Maps and bind the
        location&#39;s coordinates.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can add a text note or multimedia object, such as a photo, to a
        geographical location.
    </p>
    <p>To assign coordinates to a location do the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Enter the exact name of the location or one of the available names to the
            &quot;Name&quot; field. It is advisable to specify a modern name since
            Google Maps may know nothing about the historical names of settlements. Use
            &quot;Turkey&quot; instead of &quot;Ottoman Empire&quot;, for example&#151;then
            use a note to state at the time it was called Ottoman Empire.
        </li>
        <li>
            Click the &quot;Search&quot; button. GEDKeeper will connect with Google
            Maps and search for the location in Google&#39;s databases.
        </li>
        <li>
            If the desired location was found in the &quot;Search
            coordinates&quot; list, you can click the &quot;Select coords&quot; button to
            assign latitude and longitude of the found location to the target one. Alternatively
            you can click &quot;Use name&quot; to assign Google Map&#39;s name of the
            location or to define the name yourself.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the &quot;Search coordinates&quot; list does not have a
            matching location, you have to change the location name and search again.
            Repeat this until you find the required location.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you still cannot find a matching result, you should assign
            latitude and longitude of of the location yourself. Or find the
            nearest location to the required one, using the steps described above, and
            use that location.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The &quot;Show&quot; button opens Google Maps at the specified location.</p>

        There is a uniting table on the &quot;Locations&quot; tab of the
        main working window which includes all locations available in the
        database. A location summary to the right of the table shows all events
        connected to persons and families associated with the selected
        location.
