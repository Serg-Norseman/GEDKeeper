        Time line is a visual tool for database filtering. Moving its
        slider defines a year and the list of persons displayed are only people who
        lived in that year. In this mode the &quot;Age&quot; column shows age
        calculated relative to that year.
    </p>
    <p>
        Time line is useful on data analysis and source processing&#151;you
        can view only people who lived in an affected year. You can combine
        time line filtering with general person filtering by locations and
        names.
