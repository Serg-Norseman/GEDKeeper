    <h1>Research record</h1>

    <p>
        You use research records to manage research main directions and
        priority of those directions. You create a line of research for some family
        branch and assign a relative priority for this research. Then you track a
        period of time when the research is in progress, check the current research
        status, and its completion state.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can split research up into individual <a href="gkhRec_Task.html">tasks</a>, add
        communication with relatives or other researchers using a <a href="gkhRec_Comm.html">correspondence</a> record, and add <a href="gkhRec_Group.html">social groups</a> to easily find all people
        that were researched under this research direction.
    </p>

    <p>
        You add a description of the research progress, and associated comments, using
        <a href="gkhRec_Note.html">text notes</a>.
