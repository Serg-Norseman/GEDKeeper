    <h1>Research Record</h1>
    <p>
        You use research records to manage researching main directions and
        prioritize those directions. You can create a research record for a family
        branch and assign a relative priority for this research. Then you track a
        period of time when the research is in progress, check the current research
        status, and the completion state.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can split research up into individual <a href="gkhRec_Task.html">tasks</a>
        and add correspondence with other persons (relatives, researchers, etc.)
        using a <a href="gkhRec_Comm.html">correspondence</a> record. Add
        <a href="gkhRec_Group.html">social groups</a> to easily find all people
        that were researched under this search direction.
    </p>
    <p>
        You add a description of search progress and required comments using
        <a href="gkhRec_Note.html">text notes</a>.

        information about the selected research.
