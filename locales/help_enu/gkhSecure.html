    <h1>File Encryption</h1>

    <p>
        GEDKeeper supports storing and loading encrypted GEDCOM files. The GEDCOM standard does not support encryption, therefore
        GEDKeeper chose its own implementation for file encryption based on industry standards.
    </p>

    <p>
        Currently GEDKeeper uses an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard" target="_blank">AES</a>
        algorithm for encryption and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1" target="_blank">SHA1</a> for signing.
    </p>

    <p>
        When you are saving a database you must choose &quot;GEDKeeper encrypted GEDCOM files (*.geds)&quot; as the target file
        format. Files of this format have a file extension of &quot;.geds&quot;. After you have selected the file format and entered the file
        name, you are prompted to enter a password. When you are about to load an encrypted file, you select the same file format
        and enter your password when you are prompted.
    </p>

    <p>
        Attention: GEDKeeper uses a cryptographically secure encryption method and following &quot;security best practices&quot;
        it does not store the password within the encrypted files. Therefore, if the password is lost or forgotten nobody,
        including the GEDKeeper author, will be able to open your database file. Be prudent and enter your password carefully.
        Any symbol inadvertently added can be a cause for losing your file. Please note that passwords are case sensitive.
    </p>

        Future releases will likely include:
        <ul>
            <li>Allowing the user to choose the encryption algorithm.</li>
            <li>Prompting for the password only once for the same file.</li>
            <li>Adding a &quot;password repeat&quot; field when a file is saved the first time (to help avoid typos in the password).</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
