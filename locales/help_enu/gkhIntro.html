    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>There are three principal factors lying in the base of genealogy:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A person's name (who?).</li>
        <li>Location&#151;where an event occurred (where?).</li>
        <li>Date of an event (when?).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Using GEDKeeper you can process large amounts of genealogical data.
        The main consideration here is that GEDKeeper honors these three main
        factors. For example, one can quickly find all namesakes, or all people
        from the same community, or everyone who lived in a specific period of
        time. You can filter data using all the three factors. For example, to
        select namesakes, who lived in the same community in the specified
        year.
    </p>
    <p>
        You collect information (create a database) using different sources
        (including archives of all kinds). The following are two main sources:
        censuses
        and registers of births. Other sources are also possible, but we take
        these two sources as a basic.
    </p>
    <p>
        A database filled with entries from sources may be counted as
        conditionally complete one. For example, we have data defining all
        citizens of a specific locality at a specific period of time&#151;if we had
        used censuses. Later we were adding more and more new
        information, and finally we created a huge data array with many people
        living in several locations during different times. Such a database is
        very useful for a genealogist, because no one knows about relations
        between people in the database beforehand. This becomes more obvious
        later, after inspecting other sources, for example, registers of
        births.
    </p>
    <p>
        Why is database called conditionally complete? Because it does not
        contain strictly accurate data. Many data are approximate, or even
        estimated. For example, a date in database can be exact
        (1954.06.12), or much less exact (1954), or approximate
        (around 1976), or estimated (before 1956 or after
        1873). It is very important for the software to handle such dates
        correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
        GEDKeeper has a very efficient tool called &quot;Timeline&quot;. This
        tool can make time samples for events. Using &quot;Timeline&quot; one
        can get a model of the original source&#151;an archival document. For
        example, after we have made a time sample for 1858 using
        locations of events, we can get a list like the original source
        &#151;people who lived in a specific community in 1858 (as in the tenth
        census of 1858). This allows us to check the validity of all the
        data we have added to the database.
