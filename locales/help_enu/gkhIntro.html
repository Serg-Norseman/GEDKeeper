    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>There are three principal factors the basics of Genealogy:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A person&#39;s name (who?)</li>
        <li>Location--where an event occurred (where?)</li>
        <li>Date of an event (when?)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Using GEDKeeper you can process huge amounts of genealogical data.
        The main statement here is that GEDKeeper honors these three main
        factors. For example, you can quickly find all namesakes, or all people
        from the same community, or everyone who lived in a specific period of
        time. You can filter data using all the three factors. You could, for example,
        select namesakes and who lived in the same community in the specified year.
    </p>
    <p>
        You collect information (create a database) using different sources
        (including archives of all kinds). The following are two main sources:
        Audit tales (audits and censuses made on a more earlier or later time)
        and registers of births. Other sources are also possible, but we take
        the two sources as a basic.
    </p>
    <p>
        A database filled with entries from sources may be counted as a
        conditionally complete one. For example, we have data defining all
        citizens of a specific locality at a specific period of time; if we had
        used audits (censuses). Later we were adding more and more new
        information, and finally we accumulated a huge data array with many people
        living in several locations during different times. Such a database is
        very useful for a genealogist because no one knew about relations
        between people in the database previously. This becomes increasingly obvious
        after inspecting and including other sources.
    </p>
    <p>
        Why is a database called conditionally complete? Because it does not
        contain strictly accurate data. Many data are approximate, or even
        estimated. For example, a date in the database can be exact
        (06/12/1954), or less exact (1954), or approximate
        (around 1976), or estimated (before 1956 and after
        1873). It is very important for software to handle such dates
        correctly&#151;and GEDKeeper does!

        GEDKeeper has a very effective tool for indicating stretches of time:
        &quot;<a href="gkhSvc_TimeLine.html" target="_self">Time line</a>&quot;. This
        tool can make time samples for events. Using Time line you
        can create a model of the original source&#151;an archival document. For
        example, after we have made a time sample for 1858 using
        locations of events, we can get a list similar to the original source&#151;people
        who lived in a specific community in 1858 (as in tenth
        audit of 1858). This allows us to check the accuracy of all information
        added to database.
