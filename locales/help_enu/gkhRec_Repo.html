    <h1>Archive Record</h1>
    <p>
        Archive records combine <a href="gkhRec_Source.html">sources</a>
        located in one storage place. An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive" target="_blank">archive</a>
        is either a state archive, a private archive institution, a private
        collection, or some specific document storage.
    </p>
    <p>
        An archive has a name, storage unit list, an <a href="gkhRec_Address.html">address</a>, and other contact information.
        You can also add text notes to document items like hours of service for an instution.
