    <h1>Repository record</h1>
    <p>
        Repository records combine <a href="gkhRec_Source.html">sources</a>
        located at one storage place. A repository is either a state archive,
        private archive institution, a private collection, or some other
        document storage.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each repository has a name, storage unit list, an <a href="gkhRec_Address.html">address</a>, and other contact information.
        You can also add a text note about hours of service
        and other information.
    </p>
    <p align="center"><img src="images/dlgRepoEdit.gif"></p>

    <p>
        There is a uniting table on the &quot;Repositories&quot; tab of the main
        working window, which includes all repositories available in the database.
        A repository summary to the right of the table shows all information about the
        selected repository and sources that, according to the database, are stored in the
        selected repository.
