    <p>
        There are two setting groups for family tree generation: how persons are represented in the tree
        and how the tree appears on a render target.
    </p>

    <h4>Show individuals in tree</h4>

    <p style="text-align:center"><img src="images/dlgOptions_Charts_Trees_Persons.png"></p>

    <p>
        Here you define what data you will see in the tree:
        last name, first name and surname, birthday and obit, and what part of dates.
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Surname</dt>
        <dd>If checked then the surname, if available, will be rendered.</dd>

        <dt>Surname first in order</dt>
        <dd>
            Determines the order in which parts of the name will be displayed in the person card:
            "Surname First name Patronymic" or "First name Patronymic Surname".
        </dd>

        <dt>Given name</dt>
        <dd>If checked then the first  name, if available, will be rendered.</dd>

        <dt>Patronymic</dt>
        <dd>If checked then the patronymic, if available, will be rendered.</dd>

        <dt>Separate lines</dt>
        <dd>If checked then the first name, and patronymic if any, are rendered on separate lines. Otherwise they are on a single line separated by a space.</dd>

        <dt>Birth date</dt>
        <dd>If checked then the date of birth, if available, will be rendered.</dd>

        <dt>Death date</dt>
        <dd>If checked then the date of death, if available, will be rendered. If checked then you can choose to only show the years.</dd>

        <dt>Only years</dt>
        <dd>If the option is disabled, dates are displayed in full, otherwise - only the year, without the day and month.</dd>

        <dt>Show age</dt>
        <dd>The option enables display of the estimated age according to the date of birth and date of death (if any).</dd>

        <dt>Date of marriages</dt>
        <dd>If checked then any dates of marriage will be rendered.</dd>

        <dt>Kinship</dt>
        <dd>When this option is on, every person has a visible relation degree&mdash;which is calculated on each tree rebuild relative to the central person in the tree.</dd>

        <dt>Additional symbols</dt>
        <dd>
            This renders special symbols for some categories of people.
            There are special icons for veterans of the World War II, died, veterans of Labor, cavalier of Cross of St. George, and repressed.
            These categories are defined in the user-defined reference section in the person editor.
        </dd>

        <dt>Tree decorative</dt>
        <dd>Controls some additional graphical elements and shadows.</dd>

        <dt>Show portraits</dt>
        <dd>If checked then the person's portrait, if available, is shown. If checked, you can also choose to use a default portrait.</dd>

        <dt>Show default portraits</dt>
        <dd>
            If the option is enabled and a certain person does not have a specified portrait,
            then a template image will be displayed, indicating a man or a woman.
        </dd>

        <dt>Inverted tree</dt>
        <dd>If checked then the top-level of the tree is located at the bottom.</dd>

        <dt>Hide died in childhood</dt>
        <dd>
            This option becomes helpful when you handle several sources,
            because it can reduce the number of visible persons and make your task much simpler.
        </dd>

        <dt>Show places</dt>
        <dd>If checked, and one or more places were provided, then they are rendered.</dd>

        <dt>Separate dates and places lines</dt>
        <dd>If the option is disabled, dates of birth/death and corresponding places are displayed in one line.</dd>

        <dt>Only locality</dt>
        <dd>
            The enabled option reduces the location displayed in the person's card to only the locality,
            hiding the other parts.
            Note: location strings must be specified in the standard format - separator "," (comma).
            Note: the action depends on the option <a href="#reverse_places_order">Reverse order of places</a>,
            i.e. if the order in the fact places lines is the same, and the option does not match - instead of a settlement,
            a country may be displayed and vice versa.
        </dd>

        <dt>Hide unknown spouses</dt>
        <dd>
            If checked, and the spouse is not known, then the spouse placeholder is not rendered.
        </dd>

        <dt>Check tree size allowed</dt>
        <dd>
            If checked, then the maximum number of persons in the tree and the maximum image resolution are checked.
            This is usually unchecked as GEDKeeper no longer has any such restrictions.
        </dd>

        <dt>Dotted lines of adopted children</dt>
        <dd>
            If this option is enabled and there are adopted persons in the tree,
            the connecting lines from this person to others will be dotted
            (see <a href="gkhRec_Individual.html">Personal records</a>).
        </dd>

        <dt>Dotted lines of common law spouses</dt>
        <dd>
            If this option is enabled, divorced spouses or partners in unregistered marriages
            will be connected by dotted connecting lines.
        </dd>

        <dt>Bold font of names</dt>
        <dd>If this option is enabled, the names of people in cards will be displayed in bold.</dd>

        <dt>Minimizing width</dt>
        <dd>
            A special adjustment is made to save space on the tree image,
            and the persons are displayed less sparsely.
        </dd>

        <dt>Show special notes</dt>
        <dd>(см. <a href="gkhRec_UserRefs.html">Сноски</a>).</dd>

        <dt>Same cards width</dt>
        <dd>
            This option enables a mode in which all person cards in the tree receive the same width,
            equal to the width of the largest card in the tree.
        </dd>

        <dt>Full name on one line</dt>
        <dd>
            This option allows speakers of Eastern hieroglyphic languages ​​to display all parts of a name on one short line,
            instead of spreading the hieroglyphs across different lines.
        </dd>

        <dt>Date designations</dt>
        <dd>The option includes the traditional notations of birth dates "*" and death dates "+", as well as brackets around ("[" and "]").</dd>

        <dt>Mourning edges</dt>
        <dd>This option allows you to turn off the "mourning" frame - a wide black frame around dead people.</dd>

        <dt>Use additional dates</dt>
        <dd>
            This option allows you to display baptism or burial dates (if any) instead of missing dates
            of birth or death.
        </dd>

        <dt>Use inline images in SVG</dt>
        <dd>
            The option determines the method of saving portrait thumbnails when saving tree images to an SVG file.
            If the option is enabled, the portraits will be encoded in a special way and embedded in the SVG file;
            if the option is not enabled, the portraits will be saved as separate files in a folder with the same name as the SVG file.
        </dd>

        <dt>Extended tree</dt>
        <dd>
            The option enables the display in tree diagrams (see <a href="gkhTreeChart.html">Family Trees</a>)
            not only of the branches of the ancestors and descendants of the central person,
            but also of the branches of the ancestors of the spouses of the central person.

        <dt>Extended women's surnames</dt>
        <dd>
            The GEDCOM standard for storing genealogical information does not define a way to differentiate
            between maiden and married names for women. The GEDKeeper program
            adds a method for entering married names to the standard, but only if this option is enabled.
            In this case, a regular, always available surname is considered a maiden name.
            It is assumed that if a woman had several married surnames,
            then they will be entered in the corresponding field in a row, separated by commas.
        </dd>

        <dt>Format: Maiden surname (Married surname), Married surname (Maiden surname), Maiden surname, Married surname</dt>
        <dd>
            Controls how women's names are displayed if they are married,
            if the option to support extended women's surnames is enabled.
            As an example, we will use the name Jane whose maiden name is Smith and is now Johnson.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Format &quot;Maiden (Married)&quot;
                    <br>Example: Jane Smith (Johnson)

                <li>
                    Format &quot;Married (Maiden)&quot;
                    <br>Example: Jane Johnson (Smith)

                <li>
                    Format &quot;Maiden&quot;

        </dd>

        <dt>Simple form of single surnames</dt>
        <dd>
            If there is only a married name, and the format requires outputting only maiden names,
            the existing surname will be used. Otherwise, nothing.

            Highlighting persons with no parents or family improves navigation through the list.
            The following color scheme is applied: a white background is used for persons with family and parents,
            flaxen background for persons without family, and light red for persons without parents.
            Background colors do not prevent getting information.
        </dd>

            In the tables of events of persons or families, in the columns of presence of references to sources,
            notes or multimedia (substructures), simple "check marks" are usually displayed.
            When using this option, instead of a check mark, the number of substructures will be displayed.

            (only persons born before the child's birth date or born after the parent's birth date are displayed).
            To avoid false positives, the acceptable age of childbearing is not taken into account.
            The absence of a birth date for any persons is considered an acceptable option.

            This option defines the algorithm that will be used for filtering and searching.
            RegEx - reliable, but the slowest of the three (with a database of over 100-200 thousand people, small delays are possible).
            FastIgnoreCase - a fast filtering algorithm, there are restrictions on supported mask combinations, compares with ignoring the character case.
            Fast - the fastest filtering algorithm, there are restrictions on supported mask combinations, takes into account the character case.

            These options allow you to specify the type of numbering of persons to facilitate searching for relationships between them in the text.
            Different countries and regions have their own traditional systems.
            GEDKeeper uses the Kobrin-Konovalov and Sosa-Stradonitz systems for numbering ascending pedigrees.
            For descending pedigrees, the Kobrin-Konovalov and d'Aboville systems.
