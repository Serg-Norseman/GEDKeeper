                    <br />If checked then the first name, and patronymic if any, are rendered on separate lines. Otherwise they are on a single line separated by a space.

                    <br />When this option is on, every person has a visible relation degree&#151;which is calculated on each tree rebuild relative to the central person in the tree.

                    Additional symbols
                    <br />This renders special symbols for some categories of people.

                    Hide died in childhood
                    <br /><p>This option becomes helpful when you handle several sources, because it can reduce the number of visible persons and make your task much simpler.

                    <br />If checked, then the maximum number of persons in the tree and the maximum image resolution are checked. This is usually unchecked as GEDKeeper no longer has any such restrictions.
