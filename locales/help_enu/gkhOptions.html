    <h1>Options</h1>

    <h2>General</h2>

    <h3>Use proxy when downloading from the Internet</h3>

    <p>If you use a proxy server to connect to the Internet, then here is where it is set up. If you are not sure if you are using a proxy, then you probably are not.</p>

    <h3>Prompts</h3>

    <p>This displays a birthday reminder when the application starts up.</p>

    <h3>User interface</h3>

    <h3>Highlight unparented</h3>

    <p>
        Highlighting a person with no parents or family improves navigation through the list. The following color scheme is
        applied: a white background is used for persons with family and parents, a flaxen background for persons without a family,
        and light red for persons without parents. Colors do not have an effect on the information.
    </p>

    <a name="tree"><h2>Trees</h2></a>

    <p>
        There are two setting groups for family tree generation: how persons are represented in the tree and how the tree
        appears when it is rendered (its&#39; decor).
    </p>

    <h4>Person representation in the tree</h4>

    <p>
        Here you define what data you will see in the tree: last name, first name and surname, birthday and obit, part of
        dates, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
        When &quot;Relation degree&quot; option is on, every person has visible relation degree, that is calculated on each
        tree rebuild relative to the central person in the tree.
    </p>

    <p>
        &quot;Additional symbols&quot; shows special symbols for some categories of people. There are special icons for
        veterans of the World War II, died, veterans of Labor, cavalier of Cross of St. George, repressed. These categories are
        defined in the <a href="gkhRec_UserRefs.html">user-defined reference</a> section in person editor.
    </p>

    <p>&quot;Embellished appearance&quot; controls some additional graphical elements and shadow.</p>

    <p>
        &quot;Hide passed away in childhood&quot; option becomes helpful when you handle several sources strongly, because it
        can reduce the number of visible persons and make your task much simpler.
    </p>

    <h4>Appearance (color and font)</h4>

    <p>This setting group defines colors and the main font used in tree rendering.</p>

    <a name="pedigree"><h2>Pedigrees</h2></a>

    <p>
        Here you set up pedigree generation.
        <ul>
            <li>
                &quot;Include attributes of individuals&quot; controls if a person&#39;s life events will be
                included in the pedigree.
            </li>
            <li>
                &quot;Include notes&quot; option states that text notes from a person&#39;s biography will be included
                in the pedigree.
            </li>
            <li>
                &quot;Include sources&quot; option checks if pedigree includes source&#39;s number that references a person.
                There is the source list at the bottom of pedigree.
            </li>
            <li>
                &quot;Format&quot; option has two possible values:
                &quot;Excess&quot; and &quot;Compact&quot;. These control the level of details for a person
                description printed on the pedigree. The compact format is generally used since the excess version
                may contain too much unnecessary information.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
