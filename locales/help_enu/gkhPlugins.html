    <h1>Plug-ins</h1>

    <p>There are two types of extensions available for GEDKeeper: <a href="gkhScripts.html" target="_self">Lua scripts</a>
        and plug-ins written in C# or VB.NET.</p>

    <p>The following are the main reasons to extend an application with plug-in units:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>You want to add new functions to GEDKeeper without having to rebuild the source code and deploy a new release.</li>
        <li>
            You want to add new functions to the application but do not have the required source code (which is
            <a href="https://gedkeeper.github.io/" target="_blank">freely available</a>).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>To create plug-ins you must use the GKCore common library of this application&#39;s core.</p>
