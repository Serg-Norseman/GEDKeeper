    <h1>Expandability</h1>

    <p>There are two types of extensions available for GEDKeeper: Lua scripts and plugins written in C# or VB.NET.</p>

    <p>The following are the main reasons to extend an application with plugin units:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>You want to add new functionality to the application without having to rebuild the source code and deploy a new release.</li>
        <li>You want to add new functionality to the application, but do not have the necessary source code.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To create plugins, you must use the GKCore common library of the application's core.</p>

    <p>Plugins can include both fully independent extensions, auxiliary widgets for data management, and reports.</p>
