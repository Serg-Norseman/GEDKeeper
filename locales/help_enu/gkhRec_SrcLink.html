    <h1>A Link to Source</h1>
    <p>
        A link to source is a specialized link valid only for person, family,
        and event records that bind to a concrete <a href="gkhRec_Source.html">information source</a>. A link to source has
        three additional properties: page or sheet number, where the mentioning
        was made, and authenticity (certainty) level of the information. Having a page or
        sheet number is helpful when you need to review the source.
        An authenticity level quickly shows you how much a source of
        information may be trusted. When a source document has blots or damage and
        cannot be read with assurance, we recommend assigning the
        &quot;Questionable reliability of evidence&quot; level to the source.
        This can help prevent false conclusions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Authenticity level also affects the <a href="gkhCAIndex.html">authenticity index</a> which is calculated for
        a person in a <a href="gkhStats.html">statistics</a> module to analyze
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean" target="_blank">mean values</a>. <a href="gkhTreeChart.html">Tree diagrams</a> use the
        authenticity level to make displayed information more obvious.
