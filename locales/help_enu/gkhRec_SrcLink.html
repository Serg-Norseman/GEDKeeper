    <h1>A link to a source</h1>
    <p>
        A link to a source is a specialized link valid only for person, family,
        and event records, that binds to a concrete <a href="gkhRec_Source.html">information source</a>. A link to a source has
        two additional properties: page or sheet number where the mentioning
        was made, and authenticity level for the information. Having page or
        sheet number is helpful when you need to review the source again.
        An authenticity level quickly shows you how much you can trust a source of
        information. When a source document has blots or damages, and
        you could not have read the text with assurance, you might assign the
        &quot;Questionable reliability of evidence&quot; level to such a source.
        This can prevent you from false conclusions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Authenticity level also affects the <a href="gkhCAIndex.html">authenticity index</a>, which is calculated for
        a person in a <a href="gkhStats.html">statistics</a> module to analyze
        arithmetic mean values. <a href="gkhTreeChart.html">Tree diagrams</a> use the
        authenticity level to make displayed information more obvious.
