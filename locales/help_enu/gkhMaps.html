    <h1>Maps</h1>
    <p>GEDKeeper uses <a href="https://maps.google.com" target="_blank">Google Maps</a> (&copy; Google) to display maps.</p>
    <p>
        Using the maps service allows GEDKeeper to show you locations of births, deaths
        and the living, as defined in the database, right on a map. There are two modes
        available: one shows births, deaths or living location for all persons
        in the database; the other shows all locations of any event for the selected
        person.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before utilizing the map service, you can filter persons out
        using the general GEDKeeper filters.
    </p>
    <p>Currently printing of the maps is not supported.</p>
