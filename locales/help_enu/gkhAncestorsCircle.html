<h1>Ancestors Circle</h1>
<p>
The <em>Ancestors circle</em> is a special-purpose diagram that shows all ancestors of the selected person as sectors of concentric circles. Settings for
this diagram are available at &quot;<a href="gkhOptions.html#circle">Diagrams\Ancestors circle</a>&quot; tab in the &quot;Options&quot; window.
You can open &quot;Options&quot; dialog using the
&quot;Edit\Options...&quot; menu. Settings on the specified tab allows you to set up the diagram appearance.
</p>
<p>
To generate an &quot;Ancestors circle&quot; diagram, select a person in the persons list and then use the &quot;Ancestors circle&quot; item in the
&quot;Pedigree&quot; menu.
</p>
<p>
The following actions are available while you are viewing the diagram:
<ul>
<li>The <kbd>[ Left ]</kbd> key updates the diagram of the father for the selected person.</li>
<li>The <kbd>[ Right ]</kbd> key updates the diagram of the mother for the selected person.</li>
<li>The <kbd>[ Up ]</kbd> key increases the number of displayed generations.</li>
<li>The <kbd>[ Down ]</kbd> key decreases the number of displayed generations.</li>
<li>The <kbd>[ Backspace ]</kbd> key returns to the previous person.</li>
<li>Click a sector to update the diagram of selected person.</li>
<li>Double-click outside the diagram to change the current view mode to ancestors compositional analysis mode or revert the current mode back.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The diagram always shows a fixed number of ancestral generations (eight generations).</p>
<p>
If you have changed the central person by clicking a sector of the diagram, you can use the <img src="images/iLeft1.gif" align="middle"> and
<img src="images/iRight1.gif" align="middle"> buttons to switch to a previous or next person.
</p>
<p>
There is an additional ancestors compositional analysis mode available in the &quot;Ancestors circle&quot; diagram: you can double click outside the diagram to conduct
ancestor duplication analysis. This analysis changes the diagram as follow: all unique, non-duplicated ancestors have chlorine color, while all ancestors
having two or more occurrences have a different color (each duplicating ancestor has its own color). This allows you to evaluate genetic variety of ancestors
more clearly.
