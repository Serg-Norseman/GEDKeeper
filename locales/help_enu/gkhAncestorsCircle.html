    <h1>Ancestors Circle</h1>
    <p>
        The &quot;Ancestors Circle&quot; is a special-purpose diagram that shows all ancestors of the selected person as sectors of concentric circles. Settings for
        this diagram is available at &quot;<a href="gkhOptions.html#circle">Charts\Ancestors Circle</a>&quot; tab in the &quot;Options&quot; window. You can open the &quot;Options&quot; dialog using
        the &quot;Service\Options...&quot; menu. Settings on the specified tab allows you to set up the diagram appearance.
    </p>
    <p>To generate an &quot;Ancestors Circle&quot; diagram, select a target entry in the person list and then use the &quot;Ancestors Circle&quot; item in the &quot;Pedigree&quot; menu.</p>
    <p>
        The following actions are available while you are viewing the diagram:
        <ul>
            <li>The [<kbd>Left</kbd>] key updates the diagram for the father of the selected person.</li>
            <li>The [<kbd>Right</kbd>] key updates the diagram for the mother of the selected person.</li>
            <li>The [<kbd>Up</kbd>] key increases the number of displayed generations.</li>
            <li>The [<kbd>Down</kbd>] key decreases the number of displayed generations.</li>
            <li>The [<kbd>Backspace</kbd>] key returns to the previous person.</li>
            <li>Click a sector to update the diagram of the selected person.</li>
            <li>Double-click outside the diagram to change the current view mode to ancestors compositional analysis mode or revert the current mode back.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>The diagram always shows a fixed number of ancestral generations (eight generations).</p>
    <p>
        If you have changed the central person by clicking a sector of the diagram, you can use <img src="images/iLeft1.gif" align="absmiddle"> and
        <img src="images/iRight1.gif" align="absmiddle"> buttons to switch to a previous or next person.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is an additional ancestors compositional analysis mode available in the &quot;Ancestors circle&quot; diagram: you can double-click outside the diagram to conduct
        an ancestor duplication analysis. This analysis changes the diagram as follow: all unique, non-duplicated ancestors have chlorine color, while all ancestors
        having two or more occurrence have a different color (each duplicating ancestor has its own color). This allows you to evaluate genetic variety of ancestors
        more clearly.
