    <h1>Authenticity Index</h1>

    <p>The Authenticity Index is an attribute of data about a person as a special indicator that can be evaluated for a person entity only.</p>

    <p>Each reference to a source in a person entity has a specific authenticity level of mention for that person in the source. Authenticity level can have the following values:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unreliable evidence or estimated data (authenticity is 25%).</li>
        <li>Questionable reliability of evidence (authenticity is 50%).</li>
        <li>Secondary evidence, data officially recorded sometime after event (authenticity is 75%).</li>
        <li>Direct and primary evidences, or dominance of evidences (authenticity is 100%).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>While you are researching and viewing some information, the authenticity level shows you how much you can trust that information. It is better to set &quot;Questionable reliability of evidence&quot; if a source document had blots or was damaged and could not be read with confidence. This can prevent you from making false conclusions.</p>

    <p>If a reference to a source has no authenticity level specified in the database, it is interpreted by the program as "Unreliable evidence or estimated data" when calculating the Authenticity Index.</p>

    <p>
        The Authenticity Index is evaluated automatically for each person based on authenticity level (as the weighted arithmetic mean). You can view the Authenticity Index
        in a <a href="gkhStats.html">statistics</a> module for analysis of mean values or in <a href="gkhTreeChart.html">tree diagrams</a> for pictorial presentation. The index is evaluated using all references to sources, specified
        in both person entity and all materials and events.
