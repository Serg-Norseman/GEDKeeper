    <h1>Authenticity Index</h1>
    <p>The authenticity index ("certainty") of information about a person is a special indicator that can be evaluated for person entity only.</p>
    <p>Each reference to a source in a person entity has a specific authenticity level when mentioning that person in the source. The authenticity level can have the following values:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>&quot;Unreliable evidence&quot; indicates a 25% authenticity level.</li>
        <li>&quot;Questionable reliability of evidence&quot; indicates a 50% level of authenticity.</li>
        <li>&quot;Circumstantial evidence&quot; is data officially recorded sometime after event (authenticity is 75%).</li>
        <li>&quot;Direct and primary evidence&quot; is considered a dominance of evidences (authenticity is 100%).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        While researching and viewing some information, the authenticity level shows how much the information can be trusted. It is better to set &quot;Questionable reliability of evidence&quot;
        if a source document had blots or was damaged and could not be read with confidence. This can help prevent false conclusions.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a reference to a source has no authenticity level, the reference is considered &quot;Unreliable evidence or estimated data&quot; by default.
        The mentioning of a person in a document is an important acknowledgement by itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        The authenticity index is evaluated automatically for each person based on authenticity level (as a weighted arithmetic mean). You can view the authenticity index
        in <a href="gkhStats.html">statistics</a> module for analysis of mean values or in <a href="gkhTreeChart.html">tree diagrams</a> for pictorial presentation.
        The index is evaluated using all references to sources&#151;specified in both the person entity and all materials and the associated events.
