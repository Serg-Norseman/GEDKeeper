    <h1>Person Record</h1>

    <p>
        The Person record is the foundation of a genealogical database. Such a record contains all information
        about an individual. GEDKeeper allows you to store full name, nickname, and sex in a person record. You can also attach all events and
        facts that relate to the person&#39;s life. Using GEDKeeper you easily investigate family and social relations of
        the person (associations with other people). GEDKeeper does not restrict the number of persons or families.
        You can also divide people by different social groups, add additional indicators to improve obviousness
        (references and footnotes), add unlimited number of notes, multimedia materials, and sources. You may also add a person&#39;s
        portrait to be displayed in trees.
    </p>

    <p>The following are categories that may be edited:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="gkhRec_Event.html">Event</a> represents an event or fact from a person&#39;s life.</li>
