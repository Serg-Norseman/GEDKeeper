    <h1>Person record</h1>

    <p>
        A person record is the most important record type in a genealogical database. Such a record contains all the information
        about a person. GEDKeeper allows you to store the full name, nickname, and sex in a person record. You can list all events and
        facts that relate to the person&#39;s life. Using GEDKeeper you easily investigate family and social relations of
        the person (associations with other people). GEDKeeper never restricts you in the number of a person&#39;s families and
        children. Also, you can divide people by different social groups, add additional indicators to improve obviousness
        (references and footnotes), add unlimited number of notes, multimedia materials and sources, and add a person&#39;s
        portrait for displaying in trees.
    </p>

    <p>This is the list of dialog tabs and respective data categories you can change:</p>

    <h2><a name="person_edit">Changing person information</a></h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            You change a person&#39;s parents using a special dedicated panel with two fields&#151;for person&#39;s father and mother,
            and three groups of buttons. At first glance this may look too complex, but in action this gives flexible editing of object
            properties. The button group <img src="images/iRecNew.gif" title="Add new record" alt="add new record">,
            <img src="images/iRecEdit.gif" title="Edit current record" alt="edit current record">, and <img src="images/iRecDelete.gif" title="Delete current record" alt="delete current record"> to the right
            of the parent names modifies the parents&#39; family as a whole object. That is, you can
            use the <img src="images/iRecNew.gif" title="Add new record" alt="add new record"> button to attach an affected person to an existing family. You use the
            <img src="images/iRecEdit.gif" title="Edit current record" alt="edit current record"> button to modify properties of an already attached family without the
            necessity to close the currently opened person editing window. You use the <img src="images/iRecDelete.gif" title="Delete current record" alt="delete current record"> button
            to the right of parent names to detach a person from the family.
        </li>

        <li>
            The same buttons: <img src="images/iRecNew.gif" title="Add new record" alt="add new record">,
            <img src="images/iRecDelete.gif" title="Delete current record" alt="delete current record">, and <img src="images/iToMan.gif" title="Jump to parent" alt="jump to parent"> located under
            the name of each parent perform other functions. The <img src="images/iRecNew.gif" title="Add new record" alt="add new record"> button adds a new family
            if one was not added already, and then adds the concrete parent to this family (father or mother, depending on the
            selected section). The <img src="images/iRecDelete.gif"> button removes a parent (father or mother) from a
            person&#39;s family. To quickly jump to a parent&#39;s person record you use the <img src="images/iToMan.gif" title="Jump to parent" alt="jump to parent">
            button.
        </li>

        <li>
            There is a dedicated edit box to the right of the person&#39;s full name and sex, where you can enter additional
            information about person name: nickname, pseudonym, status, name prefix, and suffix.
        </li>

        <li>
            To modify an object of any type that is related to the affected person, you use a specific tab and the following
            standard buttons: <img src="images/iRecNew.gif" title="Add new record" alt="add new record">,
            <img src="images/iRecEdit.gif" title="Edit current record" alt="edit current record">, and <img src="images/iRecDelete.gif" title="Delete current record" alt="delete current record">.
            You can add any number of events to the affected person, that are related to his/her life, various attributes, notes,
            photos or other multimedia content, and source materials that mention the person, marriages, and groups. You use the special
            list of associations to add additional relations between people.
        </li>

        <li>
            You change information about a married couple on the &quot;Spouses&quot; tab using the
            <img src="images/iRecNew.gif" title="Add new record" alt="add new record">, <img src="images/iRecEdit.gif" title="Edit current record" alt="edit current record">,
            and <img src="images/iRecDelete.gif" title="Delete current record" alt="delete current record"> buttons. When you add or change one of conjoints, the family editor
            window appears. Using that window, you do what you need: add a spouse, children, or event. Using the arrow buttons, you can
            change the order of marriages for the selected person.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <p>
        There is a uniting table on the &quot;Persons&quot; tab of the main working window which includes all persons
        available in the database. A person summary to the right of the table shows all information about the selected person and
        references to other records.
