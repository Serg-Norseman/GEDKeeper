    <h1>Tools: Search for Patriarchs</h1>
    <p>
        This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy" target="_blank">patriarchy</a>
        tool searches the most remote ancestor in each investigated
        family tree. GEDKeeper searches through different families in the database
        and selects a male from each family that has no parents and has a
        specified number of descendant generations. When an ancestor has an
        unspecified year of birth, this year is evaluated automatically&#151;based
        on the year of birth of the closest descendants. Such rough calculations are
        made for evaluation only. For each patriarch GEDKeeper calculates both
        number of generations and number of descendants.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before you begin to work with this search, you must define the length of
        a target family branch. For example, if you need all patriarchs that
        have at least three descendant generations, enter this number in the
        &quot;Generations of not less than&quot; field. Then press the
        &quot;Search&quot; button. The search will find all matching
        patriarchs.
    </p>
    <p>
        The &quot;Ignore dates&quot; option forces GEDKeeper to not calculate the
        birthday of a patriarch. In this case, a patriarch without a defined
        birthday will show &quot;-1&quot; as the year of birth.
    </p>
    <p>
        A person with a &quot;patriarch label&quot; has the [*] sign before its name
        (see <a href="gkhNav_Labels.html">Label for an individual record</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
        You can use the &quot;Assign the sign&quot; feature to set a &quot;patriarch
        label&quot; without going to a person editor window.
    </p>
    <p>
        The &quot;Diagram&quot; button displays a &quot;Graph of
        interconnections between patriarchs&quot; diagram. This is a specialized
        tool that may appear complicated at first glance. To reduce the
        number of vertices in the graph, we recommend setting a large enough
        number of patriarch&#39;s descendant generations before viewing the diagram.
        After the diagram has been built and stabilized,
        you can see patriarchs on the the diagram as dark-blue vertices and
        intersections of their descendants&#39; branches as lilac vertices.
        A digital signature on a node is a family identifier. Hovering the mouse over
        a vertex shows the name of the family in this node. Arrows are directed from
        ancestor&#39;s family to descendant&#39;s one&#151;where two kins intersect.
