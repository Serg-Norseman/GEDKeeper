    <h1>Tools: search the patriarchs</h1>

    <p>
        This tool searches the most remote ancestor in each investigated
        family tree. GEDKeeper searches through different families in the database
        and chooses a male from each family that has no parents and has a
        specified number of descendant generations. When an ancestor has an
        unspecified year of birth, this year is evaluated automatically based
        on the year of birth of the closest descendant. Such rough calculations are
        made for evaluation only. For each patriarch GEDKeeper calculates the
        number of generations and number of descendants.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before you begin to work with this search, you must define the length of
        a target family branch. For example, if you need all patriarchs that
        have at least three descendant generations, enter this number in the
        &quot;Generations of not less than&quot; field. Press the
        &quot;Search&quot; button and this tool will find all matching
        patriarchs.
    </p>

    <p>
        The &quot;Ignore dates&quot; option forces GEDKeeper to not to calculate the
        birthday of a patriarch. In this case, patriarchs without a defined
        birthday will have &quot;-1&quot; as the year of birth.
    </p>

    <p>
        A person with the &quot;patriarch label&quot; has a &quot;[*]&quot; symbol before his name
        (see <a href="gkhNav_Labels.html">Label for an individual record</a>).
    </p>

    <p>
        You can use &quot;Set a sign&quot; to set the &quot;patriarch
        label&quot; and stay in the current tool&mdash;without changing to the person
        editor window.
    </p>

    <p>
        The &quot;Chart&quot; button displays a &quot;Graph of interconnections between patriarchs&quot;.
        To reduce the number of vertices in the graph, it is recommended to set a large enough
        number of patriarch&#39;s descendant generations before
        viewing the diagram. After the diagram has been built and stabilized,
        you can see patriarchs on the diagram as dark-blue vertices, and
        intersections of their descendants&#39; branches as lilac vertices.
        A digital signature on a node is a family identifier. Hovering the mouse over
        a vertex shows the name of the family in this node. Arrows are directed from an
        ancestor&#39;s family to a descendant&#39;s one, where two relations intersect.
