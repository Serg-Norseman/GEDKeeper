    <h1>Getting started</h1>

    <p>
        To get started working with GEDKeeper, you must first create an empty database by clicking the
        <img src="images/iCreateNew.gif" alt="new file"> button on the toolbar or selecting &quot;File\New&quot; from the menu.
    </p>

    <p>
        Using the <img src="images/iRecNew.gif" alt="new record"> button will create a new person record.
        This could be the central one for your family tree.
    </p>

    <p align="center"><img src="images/dlgPersonEdit.gif"></p>

    <p>
        You can leave any field empty if you do not have the necessary information. As time goes by, you add new data and
        relations, thus forming your family tree.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you need to load existing data, created by GEDKeeper or any other application compatible with the GEDCOM
        specification, click the <img src="images/iLoad.gif" alt="open tree file"> button or select the
        &quot;File&#47;Open...&quot; menu item. After you have selected a file, GEDKeeper loads it and you can start editing or
        processing the data.
        If you need to keep the original data intact, use the "File\Save As" menu item to save the data as a new database.
