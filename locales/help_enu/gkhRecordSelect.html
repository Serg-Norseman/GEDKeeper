    <h1>Record selection dialog</h1>
    <p>
        The record selection dialog appears in many places throughout
        GEDKeeper. Every time you need to add or select one record to or for
        another you will see this dialog. The record selection dialog has three
        main functions: select a record having a specific type, filter entries by
        part of their names, and add a required record if one does not exist.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the dialog appears, it contains a list of records depending on the
        record type. When you add a new person record for a parent or child, the
        dialog shows you all persons available in the database. When you attach an
        archive to a source, the record selection dialog will contain an archive list. When
        you add a location for an event, the dialog displays all available
        locations.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, the record selection dialog appears when you edit a person
        and you need to add a parent to this person. First, it is
        assumed that the parent has been added already and you might try to
        find it using filters. When you are sure that the parent person is
        missing in the database, you can click the &quot;Append&quot; button
        to add the parent.
