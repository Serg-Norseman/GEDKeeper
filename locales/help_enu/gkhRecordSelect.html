    <h1>Record Selection Dialog</h1>
    <p>
        The record selection dialog appears in many places throughout GEDKeeper.
        Every time you need to add or select one record to&#47;for
        another you will see this dialog. The record selection dialog has three
        main functions: select a record having specific type, filter entries by
        part of a name, and add a new record if one does not exist.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the dialog appears, it contains a list of records depending on the
        record type. When a new person record is added for a parent or child, the
        dialog shows all persons available in the database. When you attach an
        archive to source, the record selection dialog contains an archive list. When
        you add a location for an event, the dialog displays all available locations.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, the record selection dialog appears when editing a person
        and you need to add a parent to this person. First of all, it is
        assumed that the parent has been added already; you could
        find it using filters. When you are sure that the parent person is
        missing in the database, you can click the &quot;Append&quot; (add) button.
