    <h1>Event</h1>

    <p>
        There are two main record types in a genealogical database: events
        and facts. An event designates a milestone for a person or family life;
        therefore, an event can be attached to a person or family record
        only.
    </p>

    <p>
        An event has a type&mdash;it can be a predefined one or you can use
        the &quot;Fact&quot; type as a generic type and then add a user-defined type
        name. Also, for an event you can specify a location where it took place, and a
        date or date range with a calendar for the date(s). Optionally you can
        add some text notes, reference to sources, and multimedia content. For
        some events like death it is not unreasonable to specify a reason that
        caused the event and a certified organization.
    </p>

    <p>
        The &quot;Value&quot; field is valid only for events of type
        &quot;Fact&quot;. For example, the &quot;Value&quot; field for a
        &quot;Rank&quot; fact may store the rank a person had while doing
        his/her military service. For &quot;Award&quot; it may store the kind of
        the award. GEDKeeper stores all values you have entered as facts&#39;
        &quot;Values&quot;, thus you can quickly access the previous values
        from the dropdown list.
