    <h1>Event</h1>
    <p>
        There are two main record types in a genealogical database: events
        and facts. An event designates a milestone in person or family life.
        An event can only be attached to a person or family record.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each event has a type&#151;it can be a predefined one or you can use
        a &quot;Fact&quot; type as a generic type and then add a user-defined type
        name. For any event a location where it took place may be specified as well as
        a date or date range with a calendar. Optionally you can
        add some text notes, reference to sources, and multimedia content. For
        some events like death it is not unreasonable to specify a reason that
        caused the event and a certified organization.
    </p>
    <p>
        The &quot;Value&quot; field is valid only for events of type
        &quot;Fact&quot;. For example, the &quot;Value&quot; field for a
        &quot;Rank&quot; fact may store the rank a person had while performing
        military service. An &quot;Award&quot; may store any kind of
        award (e.g., the purple heart). All values you have entered are stored
        for quick access to any previous value (from the dropdown list).

        dates in the <a href="gkhDateSpecials.html">Dates Special Features</a> section.
