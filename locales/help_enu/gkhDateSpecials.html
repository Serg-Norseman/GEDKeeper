    <h1>Date Special Features</h1>

    <p>To modify the date of an event use the <a href="gkhRec_Event.html">&quot;Edit events and materials&quot;</a> dialog window.</p>

    <p>
        GEDKeeper supports the following date constraints: &quot;Exact&quot;, &quot;Before&quot;, &quot;After&quot;, &quot;Between&quot;, &quot;Period before&quot;, &quot;Period after&quot;,
        &quot;Period between&quot;, &quot;Approximately&quot;, &quot;Calculated&quot;, and &quot;Evaluated&quot;.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>The subtypes &quot;Before&quot;, &quot;After&quot;, &quot;Between&quot;, &quot;Period before&quot;, &quot;Period after&quot;, and &quot;Period between&quot; specify a range of dates.</li>
        <li>The subtypes &quot;Approximately&quot;, &quot;Calculated&quot;, and &quot;Evaluated&quot; specify inaccurate or relative dates.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Selection of which calendar is being used can be specified. GEDKeeper supports Gregorian, Julian, Jewish, French, and Roman calendars.
        You can also specify that the date is of the type Anno Domini (BC is off) or Before Christ period (BC is on).<em>
            A note for the current version of GEDKeeper:  in order to convert dates of two different calendars you must use the
            <a href="gkhSvc_Calendar.html" target="_self">Calendar</a> plug-in
        </em>.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are three operations in GEDKeeper to handle dates: storing, showing, and processing. Each operation has a specific purpose:

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Storing</strong>. All dates are stored using a special GEDCOM format. This allows you to define incomplete dates in any form.
                "26/03/1990", "26/__/1990", "__/03/1990", and "__/__/1990" are all valid examples of how a date may be entered.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Showing</strong>. When GEDKeeper must show a date, it translates it from an internal form to a string view. This may include special symbols
                (if they are enabled in the program settings). For example, &quot;Approximately 1701, January&quot; date will be rendered as &quot;__.01.1701&quot; (when special
                symbols are off) or as &quot;~ __.01.1701&quot; (when special symbols are on) in columns of general lists. Dates range like &quot;Between 01.01.1700 and 20.01.1700&quot;
                will be shown as &quot;01.01.1700 - 20.01.1700&quot;. &quot;Period before 10.10.1800&quot; date will be rendered as &quot;&lt; 10.10.1800&quot; (when special symbols are on).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Processing</strong>. When GEDKeeper processes dates (for example, performs arithmetic operations on dates or
                compares dates) it translates them into a standard form (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day" target="_top">Julian day</a>),
                that allows code comparisons and handles incomplete dates of different calendars.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        When GEDKeeper shows an incomplete date it replaces unknown parts with an underscore (the &quot;_&quot; symbol). This symbol quickly identifies
        what parts of a date are missing. This also guarantees unified presentation of all dates throughout the program.
    </p>

    <p>
        Incomplete dates are also allowed in filters on persons for birthdays and obitituaries. Therefore, it is possible to select all people born
        between 1700 and 1710&#151;without specifying days or months.
    </p>

    <p>
        To get specific understanding on processing dates and events, it is necessary to introduce both topics&#151;as they are handled in the program. Date of an event is
        some combination of known day, month, and year within the bounds of some calendar. Date may be empty or incomplete, exact, relative, or be within a range. Date does not
        contain any non-calendar information. An event is a record about occurrences which happened in a person&#39;s life. Such a record includes type of event, date, place,
        description, and some additional information. Person entry, for example, can have a record about death with empty date. This means the person has died, but when is unknown.
        Therefore, a record about a person&#39;s death and a person without such a record are processed differently.
    <p />

    <p>
        GEDKDeeper is quite unique in how birth and death events are handled. Other software usually uses a &quot;Died&quot; flag and fields that store date and
        place of death. From GEDKeeper&#39;s point of view, all events are the same. GEDKeeper processes them the same way and never limits the number of stored events. For
        purposes of the next research, a single person record is able to store several death and birth events. This allows storing several versions in case, for example, there
        is conflicting documentation.
        This provides significant flexability in the software. You do not have to write such events into the text notes or write birth and death events as range of dates.
        Moreover, having
        such an approach allows the user to attach sources of information to any event. When a researcher finds reliable information, the user can delete an incorrect
        event or mark it as erroneous. The latter allows a history to see that some information, even if it was erroneous, has been rechecked then refuted.
    </p>

    <p>The number of years in the &quot;Age&quot; and &quot;Life span&quot; columns is calculated as follow:

        <ul>
            <li>Life span is calculated strictly as the difference between birthday and obituary. If either of these dates is incomplete, nothing is done&#151;the result is undefined.</li>
            <li>
                The Age field is calculated as differences of dates between the birth and death events. This is an age when a person has died if a death event has a valid date. Age is not calculated
                when a death event exists but has no date. Age is calculated using the current date if a date for the death event has not beeen recorded. For example, if
                a person was born in 1700 and yet has no death event, in 2015 GEDKeeper shows its &quot;Age&quot; as 315 years. To avoid this when a death has occurred,
                even if you do not know when it happened, always add a death event with an empty date.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        To make processing of large amounts of data more efficient, GEDKeeper offers a check
        database service (accessible from the &quot;Service\Tools&quot; menu, &quot;Check database&quot; tab). This service checks all person records for those without a death event.
        If a calculated age exceeds scientifically proven limits of a human life, the service suggests a
        fix for a death event where the user may select a suggestion and click the &quot;Fix&quot; button. For GEDKeeper the limit of a human life is 122 years (see the
        &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_verified_oldest_people" target="_top">List of the verified oldest people</a>&quot; Wikipedia page). Please note
        that the checking function does not set an obit of a person to the maximum value&#151;it just creates an empty death event as an indicator.
