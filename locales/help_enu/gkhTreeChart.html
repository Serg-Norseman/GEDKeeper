    <h1>Family Tree</h1>

    <p>
        Three types of tree diagrams are available: tree of ancestors (ascending relationship tree), tree of
        descendants (descending relationship tree), and combined tree (ancestors and descendants). You can set up the
        diagram appearance in the &quot;Options&quot; dialog on the &quot;<a href="gkhOptions.html#tree">Tree</a>&quot; tab
        (accessed by the &quot;Options&quot; dialog via the &quot;Edit&#47;Options...&quot; menu item). You can change information to
        show about persons and change colors of tree elements.
    </p>

    <p>
        To build a tree, you pick a person from the person list. Then choose a tree type (ancestors, descendants, or complete)
        in the &quot;Pedigree&quot; menu. The following main window&#39;s toolbar&#39;s buttons may also be used:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><img src="images/iTreeAncestry.gif" align="middle">&nbsp;Tree of ancestors</li>
        <li><img src="images/iTreeDescendants.gif" align="middle">&nbsp;Tree of descendants</li>
        <li><img src="images/iTreeBoth.gif" align="middle">&nbsp;Complete tree</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        After a tree is created, you can use the <img src="images/iSaveImage.gif" align="middle"> button to export the
        tree in one of the following formats: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics" target="_blank">raster format</a>
        (BMP, JPEG, PNG or, GIF) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics" target="_blank">vector format</a> (EMF, SVG). Not every family tree
        may be saved as a raster (bitmap) file. Bitmaps may not store more than 65k pixels per horizontal line. Vector files
        do not have such restriction; therefore it can store trees of any size. Moreover, a vector file is better for
        additional image processing in graphical applications and for printing.
    </p>

    <p>The following controls are available when you view a diagram:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Vertical scrolling with mouse wheel.</li>
        <li>Horizontal scrolling with mouse wheel and holding the <kbd>[ Shift ]</kbd> key.</li>
        <li>Zoom with mouse wheel and holding the <kbd>[ Ctrl ]</kbd> key.</li>
        <li>Zoom with scale control at top right corner of the window.</li>
        <li><kbd>[ F4 ]</kbd> performs the folding or unfolding of the selected person's branch.</li>
        <li><kbd>[ F5 ]</kbd> rebuilds the tree.</li>
        <li><kbd>[ F6 ]</kbd> marks the currently selected person as a starting point and updates all ancestors and descendants of the starting point.</li>
        <li><kbd>[ F7 ]</kbd> recalculates the relation degrees of the selected person (if that option is turned on).</li>
        <li>Double-click on a person to open it in edit mode.</li>
        <li>Click on a person to adjust it with the window&#39;s center.</li>
        <li>Pan the content while holding the right mouse button.</li>
        <li>Click on the <img src="images/iExpand.gif" align="middle"> icon (&quot;if there is additional hidden data&quot;) near a person to rebuild the tree relative to that person (this icon is not exported to any image file).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The number of visible generations, of both ancestors and descendants, can be adjusted from one to nine or unlimited
        by the button with drop down menu on the window&#39;s toolbar.
    </p>

    <p>Content may also be filtered by the <img src="images/iFilter.gif" align="middle"> button.</p>

    <p>
        If the [ F6 ] key is used or the <img src="images/iExpand.gif" align="middle"> icon (set new person as a central one
        for the tree), then you can use the <img src="images/iLeft1.gif" align="middle"> and <img src="images/iRight1.gif" align="middle">
        buttons to return to the previous or next person.
    </p>

    <p>The <img src="images/iTools.gif" align="middle"> icon dispalys the following tree options:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>All -- show both ancestors and descendants for a selected person.</li>
        <li>Ancestors only -- only ancestors of the selected person are visible.</li>
        <li>Descendants only -- only descendants of the selected person are visible.</li>
        <li>Center auto-change -- toggle off/on a mode when the center of the tree is smoothly adjusted with the selected person.</li>
        <li>Authenticity index -- toggle off/on the authenticity index visibility for each person in the tree (it is handy for visual valuation of development progress).</li>
        <li>Background color -- change the background color for this tree.</li>
        <li>Background image -- change the background image for this tree.</li>
    </ul>
