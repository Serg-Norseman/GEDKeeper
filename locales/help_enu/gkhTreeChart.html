    <h1>Family tree</h1>

    <p>
        There are three types of tree diagrams GEDKeeper can create: tree of ancestors (ascending relationship tree), tree of
        descendants (descending relationship tree), and a combined tree (tree of ancestors and descendants). You can set up
        the diagram appearance from the &quot;Service\Options&quot; menu in the &quot;Options&quot; dialog on the &quot;Charts\<a href="gkhOptions.html#tree">Trees</a>&quot; tab.
        You can change what information to show about persons and change colors of tree elements.
    </p>

    <p>
        To build a tree, you pick a person out in person list, then choose a tree type (ancestors, descendants, or complete)
        in the &quot;Pedigree&quot; menu. Alternatively, you can use the following buttons from the main window:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><img src="../help/images/iTreeAncestry.gif" alt="Tree of ancestors">&nbsp;Tree of ancestors</li>
        <li><img src="../help/images/iTreeDescendants.gif" alt="Tree of descendants">&nbsp;Tree of descendants</li>
        <li><img src="../help/images/iTreeBoth.gif" alt="Complete tree">&nbsp;Complete tree</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        After a tree is created, you can use the <img src="../help/images/iSaveImage.gif" alt="save"> button to export the
        tree in one of the following formats: raster format (BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG) or vector (EMF, SVG). Not every family tree
        may be saved as a raster file since they may not store more than 65k pixels per horizontal line. Vector files
        do not have such restrictions. Therefore, a vector format can store trees of any size. Moreover, having a vector file may be better for
        the next image processing in graphical applications and printing.
    </p>

    <p>The following controls are available when you view a diagram:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Vertical scrolling with mouse wheel.</li>
        <li>Horizontal scrolling with mouse wheel and holding the [<kbd>Shift</kbd>] key.</li>
        <li>Zoom with mouse wheel and holding the [<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>] key.</li>
        <li>Zoom with scale control at top right corner of the window.</li>
        <li>The [<kbd>F4</kbd>] key performs the folding or unfolding of the selected person's branch.</li>
        <li>The [<kbd>F5</kbd>] key rebuilds the tree.</li>
        <li>
            The [<kbd>F6</kbd>] key marks the currently selected person as a starting point and updates all ancestors and
            descendants of that starting point.
        </li>
        <li>The [<kbd>F7</kbd>] key recalculates relation degrees (if they are turned on) of the currently selected person.</li>
        <li>Double-click on a person to enter edit mode for that person.</li>
        <li>Click on a person to adjust it with the window&#39;s center.</li>
        <li>Pan the content while the mouse&#39;s right button is held.</li>
        <li>
            click on the <img src="../help/images/iExpand.gif" alt="expand"> icon (&quot;there are additional hidden data&quot;) near
            a person to rebuild the tree relative to that person (this icon is not exported to an image file).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The number of visible generations (of both ancestors and descendants) can be adjusted from one to nine (or unlimited)
        by the &quot;Generations&quot; button using the dropdown menu.
    </p>

    <p>You can also filter content with the <img src="../help/images/iFilter.gif" alt="filter"> button.</p>

    <p>
        If you have used the [<kbd>F6</kbd>] key or the <img src="../help/images/iExpand.gif" alt="expand"> icon (set new person as the central one
        for the tree), you can use the <img src="../help/images/iLeft1.gif" alt="left"> and <img src="../help/images/iRight1.gif" alt="right">
        buttons to return to the previous or next person.
    </p>

    <p><img src="../help/images/iTools.gif" alt="tools button"> shows the following tree options:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>All &mdash; show both ancestors and descendants for a specified person.</li>
        <li>Ancestors only &mdash; only ancestors of the selected person are visible.</li>
        <li>Descendants only &mdash; only descendants of the selected person are visible.</li>
        <li>Trace root &mdash; turns off/on a mode when the center of the tree is smoothly adjusted with the selected person.</li>
        <li>
            The certainty index &mdash; turns off/on the authenticity index visibility for each person in the tree (it is handy for visual
            valuation of development progress).
        </li>
        <li>Background color &mdash; changes the background color for the tree.</li>
        <li>Background image &mdash; changes the background image for the tree.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Other hotkeys:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The [<kbd>Ctrl + F</kbd>] key performs the quick person search by name.</li>
        <li>The [<kbd>Ctrl + S</kbd>] key performs the save current database.</li>
    </ul>
