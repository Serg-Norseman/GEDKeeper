    <h1>Tools: check connection of families</h1>
    <p>
        This is an analysis tool used to check the number of fully
        interrelated families. The tool starts from a person and then processes
        all persons that have any relation with the initial person&#151;regardless
        of relation degree. All inspected persons are combined into
        one group. All persons interrelated with each other, but not with
        the first group, are combined into other groups.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can develop several unrelated families in one database. This
        tool gives you ability to visually manage their composition. Also, you
        can use this tool as an integrity checking procedure. For example, for
        cases when you removed a person from a family but did not add that
        person to some other family. In such cases, this tool
        shows the person as disjointed from all groups.
    </p>
    <p>
        Double-click on a person in a group list to open this person in the
        main working list of the database. This may be helpful when you want to
        make some changes.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a database fragmentation diagram under the list of group
        contents. For better visual perception the diagram has a logarithmic
        scale, therefore the size of a segment is not directly proportional to the number
        of persons in the relative group. This decreases the size of large
        segments yet keeps small fragments clearly visible. Hovering the mouse
        over a fragment displays the fragment&#47;group number and its size.
