    <p>&quot;Family history is the Motherland.&quot; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Pushkin" target="_blank">Aleksandr Sergeevich Pushkin</a>)</p>
    <p>&quot;Contempt of ancestors is the first sign of savagery and immorality.&quot; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Pushkin" target="_blank">Aleksandr Sergeevich Pushkin</a>)</p>
    <p>&quot;The most important thing in the world is family and love.&quot; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wooden" target="_blank">John Wooden</a>)</p>
    <p>&quot;Other things may change us, but we start and end with the family.&quot; (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/202465.Anthony_Brandt" target="_blank">Anthony Brandt</a>)</p>
    <p>&quot;Family is not an important thing. It’s everything.&quot; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Fox" target="_blank">Michael J. Fox</a>)</p>
    <p>&quot;The family is one of nature’s masterpieces.&quot; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Santayana" target="_blank">George Santayana</a>)</p>
    <p>&quot;Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family: Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one.&quot; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Howard_(journalist)" target="_blank">Jane Howard</a>)</p>
    <p>&quot;It’s important to teach our children their heritage. Who are your ancestors? What were their traditions? Each of us has a story to tell. If these stories are unwritten, then how are your children going to know of their parentage?&quot; (<a href="http://www.lindaweaverclarke.com/" target="_blank">Linda Weaver Clarke</a>)</p>
    <p>&quot;Everyone has a story. Every story matters.&quot; (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/nicole.w.miller.94" target="_blank">Nicole Wedemeyer Miller</a>)</p>
    <p>&quot;In our family histories, the frontier between fact and fiction is vague, especially in the record of events that took place before we were born, or when we were too young to record them accurately; there are few maps to these remote regions, and only the occasional sign to guide the explorer.&quot; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Sisman">Adam Sisman</a>)</p>
    <p>&quot;Just like our ancestors, we too will fall out of living memory and be forgotten. It will take a future genealogist to find us again. Make it a good find.&quot; (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/stephenrobertkuta/" target="_blank">Stephen Robert Kuta</a>)</p>
    <p>&quot;My family tree has many branches, both living and dead... but all equally important. I cherish the memories that make its roots run deep.&quot; (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/8442123.Lynda_I_Fisher" target="_blank">Lynda I Fisher</a>)</p>
    <p>&quot;A person in search of his ancestors naturally likes to believe the best of them, and the best in terms of contemporary standards. Where genealogical facts are few, and these located in the remote past, reconstruction of family history is often more imaginative than correct.&quot; (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14058.James_G_Leyburn" target="_blank">James G. Leyburn</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/25780" target="_blank">The Scotch-Irish: A Social History</a>)</p>
    <p>&quot;Roots are, I’m learning, as important as wings.&quot; (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Michele-Huey-Author-Speaker-137821632976314/" target="_blank">Michele T. Huey</a>)</p>
