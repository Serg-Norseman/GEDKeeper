    <h1>Pedigrees</h1>

    <p>
        GEDKeeper has the ability to generate a pedigree for generations. There are two pedigree schemes available:
        d&#39;Aboville and Konovalov. Both schemes make nearly identical pedigrees with the only difference being in
        persons numbering.
    </p>

    <p>
        d&#39;Aboville&#39;s scheme assigns #1 to the first person in the first generation; the person's first descendant in
        the next generation gets #1.1; grandchild gets #1.1.1, and so on. This system is suitable when one has started to create
        a draft tree on paper. It is easy to add elements to any generation in the pedigree using d&#39;Aboville&#39;s scheme.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a name="Konovalov">Konovalov&#39;s</a> scheme gives numbers like &quot;X-Y&quot; to all people, where &quot;X&quot; is the sequence number for a
        person in the pedigree, and &quot;Y&quot; is number of the person's ancestor. This system provides easy navigation, but
        it is hard to manage Konovalov&#39;s scheme using paper as a medium. Adding new persons to existing generations will
        be a tough task&#151;numbering get broken and the pedigree becomes a mess.
    </p>

    <p>
        GEDKeeper sees little differences between these two schemes and allows you to create pedigrees using either one.
        Choosing a scheme is based on user preferences (appearance of the pedigree, and how to view and manage the pedigree).
    </p>

    <p>
        To create a pedigree using one of the schemes described above, select the required entry in the person list, and find the menu
        item with the scheme name in the &quot;Pedigree&quot; menu. You may also use the <img src="images/iScroll.gif" align="absmiddle" title="Pedigree">
        button on the toolbar.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are several file formats you can export pedigrees to: HTML, RTF, and PDF. The exported file includes hyperlinks
        between persons in the tree. Once GEDKeeper has created a target file, it then opens the file in the program that was
        registered in your system as the default action for the target file type. You can use that program, for example, to
        print the pedigree.
    </p>

    <p>You can find settings for pedigree generation in the &quot;Options&quot; dialog on the &quot;Pedigrees&quot; tab.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>When the &quot;Include person attributes&quot; option is on, the pedigree includes a person&#39;s life events.</li>
        <li>When the &quot;Include notes&quot; option is on, the pedigree includes text notes from a person&#39;s biography.</li>
        <li>
            When the &quot;Include sources&quot; option is on, the pedigree includes source numbers that reference a person.
            There is a source list at the bottom of the pedigree.
        </li>
        <li>
            The &quot;Format&quot; option has two possible values: &quot;Excess&quot; and &quot;Compact&quot;. This option
            controls the level of detail for a person description printed in a pedigree. Usually, you would use the Compact format,
            because Excess may contain too much unnecessary information.
        </li>
    </ul>
