    <h1>Pedigrees</h1>

    <p>
        GEDKeeper has the ability to generate a generational pedigree. There are two pedigree schemes available:
        d&#39;Aboville&#39;s and Konovalov&#39;s. The only difference betweeen the two is the person numbering method.
    </p>

    <p>
        d&#39;Aboville&#39;s scheme assigns #1 to the first person in the first generation. The person&#39;s first descendant in
        the next generation is #1.1, the grandchild is #1.1.1, and so on. This system is suitable when you have started to create a tree
        draft on paper&#151;it is easy to add elements to any generation in the pedigree using d&#39;Aboville&#39;s scheme.
    </p>

    <p>
        Konovalov&#39;s scheme gives numbers like &quot;X-Y&quot; to all people, where &quot;X&quot; is a sequential number for a
        person in the pedigree, and &quot;Y&quot; is the number of the person&#39;s ancestor. This system provides easy navigation but
        may be hard to manage on paper. Adding new persons to existing generations would
        be a tough task; numbering get broken and the pedigree becomes a mess.
    </p>

    <p>
        GEDKeeper sees little difference between the two schemes. Choosing a scheme is based on your personal <a href="gkhOptions.html#pedigree" target="_self">preference</a> (appearance of
        pedigree, and how to view and manage a pedigree).
    </p>

    <p>
        To create a pedigree using one of the schemes described above, select an entry in the person list. Then find the menu
        item with the scheme name in the &quot;Pedigree&quot; menu. Alternately you can use the <img src="images/iScroll.gif" align="middle" title="Pedigree">
        button on the toolbar.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can export pedigrees to HTML, PDF, and RTF formats. The exported file includes hyperlinks
        between persons in the tree. Once GEDKeeper has created the target file, it then opens it with the
        registered program in your system as the default action for the target file type. You can use that program to
        print or modify the pedigree.
    </p>

    <p>You can find settings for pedigree generation in the &quot;Options&quot; dialog on the &quot;Pedigrees&quot; tab including:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>When &quot;Include person attributes&quot; option is on, pedigree includes a person&#39;s life events.</li>
        <li>When &quot;Include notes&quot; option is on, pedigree includes text notes from a person&#39;s biography.</li>
        <li>
            When &quot;Include sources&quot; option is on, pedigree includes all source numbers that references a person.
            There is a list of sources at the bottom of a pedigree.
        </li>
        <li>
            The &quot;Format&quot; option has two possible values: &quot;Excess&quot; and &quot;Compact&quot;. This option
            controls the level of detail for person description printed in the pedigree. Using the Compact format is generally used
            since the excess one may contain too much unnecessary information.
        </li>
    </ul>
