    <h1>Note Record</h1>
    <p>
        Notes are used to add minimal, unformatted text to most record types. A note
        can contain fragments of a <a href="gkhRec_Source.html">source</a> text,
        scratches and drafts added to <a href="gkhRec_Individual.html">persons</a>,
        <a href="gkhRec_Family.html">families</a> or <a href="gkhRec_Media.html">multimedia content</a>,
        <a href="gkhRec_Research.html">research</a> notes, iniformation about
        <a href="gkhRec_Place.html">location</a> history, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please do not take a note object as some kind of large formatted
        document. The latter must be added to the database as <a href="gkhRec_Media.html">multimedia content</a>.
        The number of notes is unlimited&#151;as is references made to a note from other objects.

        There is a table on the &quot;Notes&quot; tab of the main working
        window where you can find all notes stored in the database. Each note
        record has a summary area to the right of the table where you can find
        the list of notes that refer to the selected note.
