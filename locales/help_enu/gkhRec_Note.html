    <h1>Note record</h1>

    <p>
        Notes are used to add small text to various database records. A note
        can contain a fragment of a <a href="gkhRec_Source.html">source</a> text,
        scratches, and drafts added to <a href="gkhRec_Individual.html">persons</a>, <a href="gkhRec_Family.html">families</a> or <a href="gkhRec_Media.html">multimedia content</a>, <a href="gkhRec_Research.html">research</a> notes, sketches about <a href="gkhRec_Place.html">location</a> history, and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please do not take a note object as some kind of large formatted
        document. Those should be added to the database as <a href="gkhRec_Media.html">multimedia content</a>. There are no limits
        applied to the number of references made to a note from other objects.
    </p>

        There is a table on the &quot;Notes&quot; tab of the main working
        window, where you can find all notes stored in the database. Each note
        record has a summary area to the right of the table, where you can find a
        list of notes that refer to the selected one.
