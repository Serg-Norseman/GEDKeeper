<h1>Note record</h1>
<p>You use notes to add small text to various database records. Note
can contain fragment of a <a href="gkhRec_Source.html">source</a> text,
scratches and drafts added to <a
href="gkhRec_Individual.html">persons</a>, <a
href="gkhRec_Family.html">families</a> or <a
href="gkhRec_Media.html">multimedia content</a>, <a
href="gkhRec_Research.html">research</a> notes, sketches about <a
href="gkhRec_Place.html">location</a> history and so on.</p>
<p>Please do not take a note object as some kind of large formatted
document. The latter should be added to database as <a
href="gkhRec_Media.html">multimedia content</a>. There are no limits
applied to the number of references made to a note from other
objects.</p>

<p>There is a table on the &quot;Notes&quot; tab of the main working
window, where you can find all notes stored in database. Each note
record has a summary area to the right of the table, where you can find
list of notes that refer to the selected one.</p>
