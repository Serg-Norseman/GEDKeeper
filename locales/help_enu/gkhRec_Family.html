    <h1>Family Record</h1>
    <p>
        A Family record is one of the main record types available in a
        genealogical database. Family records store information about family,
        conjoints, events,data from the family&#39;s life, and children. You
        can also add text notes, references to sources, and multimedia objects into
        a family record.

        There is a table on the &quot;Families&quot; tab of the main working
        window where you can find all families stored in the database. Each family
        record has a summary area to the right of the table where you can view
        entire information about family, conjoints, children, and events. You can
        easily navigate to other records from here.
