    <h1>Family record</h1>
    <p>
        The family record is one of the main record types available in a
        genealogical database. Family records store information about a family,
        conjoints, events, and data from the family&#39;s life and children. You
        can also add text notes, references to sources, and multimedia objects into
        a family record.

    <p>
        There is a table on the &quot;Families&quot; tab of the main working
        window, where you can find all families stored in the database. Each family
        record has a summary area to the right of the table, where you can view
        the entire information about a family, conjoints, children, events, and where
        you can jump to other records.
