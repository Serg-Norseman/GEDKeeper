# Kinship type `Signatures` are necessary for a readable and maintainable association of types with definitions.
# `Name` strings starting with `@` - denote codes for built-in program localization strings.
# `HasExt` denotes kinship types that have an extended definition (consanguineous, adoption, common-law marriage).
# `Description` is only needed to support and develop the content of this file.
# `Index` is essential for debugging this file and verifying it.
