# Brief description of the kinship determination algorithm:
# - A graph (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)) is built from nodes (persons)
#   and bidirectional links between them (the simplest types of kinship);
#   - A graph for determining kinships in a tree is built along the entire tree;
#   - A graph for the kinship calculator is built from the first person until the second is found;
# - Between two persons for whom the name of the type of kinship needs to be found - the shortest path
#   (a chain of nodes and links) is built;
# - Primary types of relations: Parent <-> Child, Spouse <-> Spouse.
# - For all links from the shortest path, a secondary type is determined based on the primary type and sex of the nodes;
# - Secondary types of relations: Father, Mother, Son, Daughter, Husband, Wife.
# - A step-by-step analysis of the chain is launched, where the type of each link and the previous one is compared
#   with a set of definitions (rules) from the file of the culture of kinship relations (this file);
# - If a suitable definition is found, the type of the current link is replaced by the result of the definition;
# - In the case when it is impossible to find a suitable definition, a "break" is performed at this step
#   and the kinship determination continues from the current person further. That is, a complete definition of kinship
#   can be composed of 2 or more parts.
# - Only single-part kinship types can be displayed in the tree. Complex ones with several parts can be displayed only in the calculator.

# Exceptions:
# - There are a number of exceptions defined in the algorithm instead of this definition file (eg cousin types like 1st degree brother/sister).
# - Grandfather/grandmother types (N-degree) in the previous step and son/daughter in the current one - the result will be grandfather/grandmother of degree N+1 and G-1.

# The "kinship culture" file is reloaded every time the calculator or tree diagrams are run.
# The file name should be `kinships{.lang3L}.yaml` (folder `externals`), where `lang3L` is the three-letter language code from the localization file.

GreatPrefix: '@376'

# `Index` is essential for debugging this file and verifying it.
# Kinship type `Signatures` are necessary for a readable and maintainable association of types with definitions (and built-in types).
# `Name` strings starting with `@` - denote codes for built-in program localization strings.
# `Name` strings without code - can be set directly, bypassing the general localization of the program.
# `HasExt` denotes kinship types that have an extended definition (consanguineous, adoption, common-law marriage).
# `Description` is only needed to support and develop the content of this file.

# Types:
#   - `ktNone`, `ktUndefined`, `ktSame`,
#   - `ktParent`, `ktSpouse`, `ktChild`,
#   - `ktFather`, `ktMother`, `ktHusband`, `ktWife`, `ktSon`, `ktDaughter`
# are important service (basic) types necessary for the algorithm to work.
# It is forbidden to delete, move, change indexes and other parameters (except localization).

# `Index` is essential for debugging this file and verifying it.
# `Enable` allows to turn off the rules for determining kinship types without deleting or commenting them out.
# `PrevPrevious`, `Previous` and `Current` are the relationship types at the pre-previous, previous and current step of the analysis chain.
# `Result` is the result type of this definition.
# If the match is successful, `Current` will be replaced by `Result` and will proceed to the next step of chain analysis as `Previous`.
# `ktSame` is a utility type that does not change the type of the kinship of the analyzed chain step.
# `Great` and `Degree` - define the delta value (-1, 0, +1) of these indicators on a given type (and chain's step).
